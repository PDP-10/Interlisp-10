<LISP>DIR.INFO

There is a new function for performing operations on your
directory - the type you always wanted but were afraid to ask.
In addition to a nice set of commands, it permits specifying
file names a la editor - i.e. $ can match any sequence
of characters, and also for specifying subsets of
file directories, e.g. all files beginning with FOO
+ all .TXT files, etc. 

dir[filegroup; commands; defaultext; defaultvers]

filegroup is either an atom with $'s or *'s (equivalent)
which match any number of characters, and ?'s to match
a single character, or else a list of the form
(filegroup + filegroup), (filegroup - filegroup),
or (filegroup * filegroup). You can also
use OR for +, AND for *. 
(T$ + $L) will match with any file beginning with T or ending in L,
(T$ - *.COM) matchs all files that begin with T and are
not .COM files.


Commands (executed for EACH file except OUT):
@ FN	apply FN to JFN of file; if returns NIL, abort command
	processing for this file.

P	prints file name

PAUSE	wait for user to type any char (good for display 
	if you want to ponder)

PROMPT msg	prompts with msg; if user responds with
		N, abort command processing for this file.

SIZE 		print file size (in pages) and total at end

TRIMTO n	deletes all but n versions of file (N positive)
		(You should use ;0, meaning "latest version"
		for the version number in this case)

OUT file 	directs output to file

COLLECT  	adds file onto a list which is returned as
		the value of DIR

DATE		prints date last written

DELETE		deletes file

DIR uses DIRCOMMANDS to correct spelling, so this provides a way
of defining abbreviations and synonyms. currently the following
abbreviations are recognized:
TI		same as DATE
DEL		same as DELETE
DEL?		same as PROMPT  " delete?"  DELETE
COLLECT?	same as PROMPT "? " COLLECT

There is a new lispxmacro which calls the
function DIR:
DIR group commands 	calls the function DIR with (P . commands)
		as the command list and * and * as the default
		extension and version respectively.

For example, to DELVER only those files which you ok, do

DIR group PROMPT TRIMTO 1

To print out those files which satisfy some predicate , do

(DIR 'group '(@ pred P]
