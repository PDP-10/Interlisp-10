User HELP features in INTERLISP

(1) there is a lispx command ? which, following an error
prints out 'why' (if it can). E.g. if you type in
(ELT 3 FOO)  and get an ARG NOT ARRAY error,
and then type ? it will say because the first argument
of elt is supposed to be an array and 3 isnt, etc.
note that ? can take an event specification.
this feature will continually be expanding and evolving.

(2) ? typed during typein by itself and followed immediately
by a c.r. will invoke HELPSYS on the expression being typed
and allow you to continue typing afterwards. (you can
abort HELPSYS with a control-e without harm) e.g.
if you are typing 
DEFINEQ((FOO (LAMBDA -- (STKPOS and forget the arguments type ?
followed by c.r. and you will get a HELPSYS response.

(3) typing ?= in followed immediately by c.r. will do the same
as ? except will simply type out the names of the arguments
for the indicated function followed by the values, as if
you were in a break. (this often is all the information you need)
e.g. if you are typing LOADFROM(FOO ?=
it will give you arguments to loadfrom and let you continue typing.
note that this does not effect the ?= command in break which still works as it did. however, the ? command in break and lispx (the
one that prints the commands) is now superceded by (1) above.

(4) typing ?= in the editor will have the effect of (3) above with
respect to the current expression.

note that if you type LIST(A B ? C) or (QUOTE ?) the ? is
treated normally. i.e. ? only has a special function when
it is the last thing on a line, or when it precedes
an = which is the last thing on a line.

----------
latest developments on ? feature:

_DEFINEQ((FOO (LAMBDA (X) (FIE (CAR X) (CDR X)))))
(FOO)
_DEFINEQ((FIE (LAMBDA (X Y) (NTH X Y))))
(FIE)
_PUT(FOO INFO ((LISTP (CAR X)) (NUMBERP (CDR X))))
((LISTP (CAR X)) (NUMBERP (CDR X)))
_FOO(((A B C D E) 3))

NON-NUMERIC ARG
(3)
in NTH

(broken)
:?
because NTH requires that N (its second argument) be a number
but in (NTH X Y) {in FIE}, the value of Y is
(3)
:?
it could be because FOO expects that CDR of X (its first argument) 
will be a number but in FOO(((A B C D E) 3)),
this is not the case.

------
there are two things of interest here. first, the user
can instruct the system about the conventions of
his programs. (the PUT expression above says
that the user expects FOO's first argument to
always look like (list . number).

when an error occurs, he can obtain the immediate
diagnosis as before. typing a second ? will
then cause the system to search back up the
stack looking for something 'not right' and to
print out an appropriate message.

HELPSYS itself has been greatly improved. Many
subjects previously missing have been found.
Spelling correction, and alt-mode completion
is also available. e.g. if you
dont remember the name of a particular flag,
you can say TELL ME ABOUT CLISP$FLG and get a list
of the possible topics, and select which one you want.
