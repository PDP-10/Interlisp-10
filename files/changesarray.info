<LISP>CHANGESARRAY.INFO

if the variable CHANGESARRAY is set to a hash array
(or list of a hasharray), the editor will mark all expressions
that are changed by doing a puthash on the expression using
the name of the function/variable/atm as the hash value.
The algorithm used for marking changes is as follows:

(1) if the expression is already inside of another expression
marked as being changed, do nothing

(2) if the change is an insertion or replacement of a list,
mark the list as changed

(3) if the change is an insertion or replacement of an atom,
or a deletion, mark the parent as changed.

the primary reason for CHANGESARRAY is the following feature, although
there may be other applications.

If the value of the variable CHANGECHAR is not NIL,
prettyprint will print CHANGECHAR in the right hand margin
on all lines containing changed material.

CHANGESARRAY and CHANGECHAR are initially NIL. at PARC
however, CHANGESARRAY is initialized to (LIST (HARRAY 100))
and CHANGECHAR is |. I have found that a fairly lengthy
editing session, e.g. four hours on the machine, only
results in the hash array growing once,
i.e. to 150. If files are to read in correctly, CHANGECHAR must be
a separator character in FILERDTBL.

note that the algorithm for printing the character in
the right margin assumes that c.r. without line feed
is supported by your line printer. (this is the tenex standard).
i had to do it that way for various reasons involving font
applications at parc.

you can also get the change char to be printed when printing
to a display terminal (presumably you wouldnt want to wait to
space to the right margin all the time on a hard copy terminal).
