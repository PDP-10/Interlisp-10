There is a new function in the system called SMARTARGLIST. It
is the same as ARGLIST for non-subrs but for subrs, it consults
the HELPSYS data base to obtain the arguments as indicated in
the manual. SMARTARGLIST has a second argument, EXPLAINFLG.
if EXPLAINFLG=NIL, and the function is a nospread, then
SMARTARGLIST defaults to ARGLIST. This is because if you are
doing a BREAK or ADVISE, then you don't want as 'arglist'
of items to return (X1 X2 ... XN).

If the helpsys data base isn't there, SMARTARGLIST defaults to
arglist.

>>>> NOTE - If you have advice on subrs, and rely on U V and W
being the argument names, you will have to fix your advice
since now it will get the 'real' names.  <<<<<<

SMARTARGLIST uses the property ARGNAMES both as a way of overriding
the value to be returned by HELPSYS, and also to avoid having to
call HELPSYS twice. the value of the property is either the arglist
in the case of spread functions, i.e. where the same arglist can be
used for breaking and advising as for explanations, or for
nospreads a list CAR of which is NIL, CADR is the explanatory
arglist, and CDDR the real arglist, e.g. for DEFINEQ, would be
(NIL (X1 X2 ... XN) . X)
SMARTARGLIST returns the ARGNAMES property for case 1,
CADR of the property for nospreads when EXPLAINFLG is T
and CDDR when it is NIL. When SMARTARGLIST does call HELPSYS,
it saves the result on ARGNAMES on the grounds that if
you break on INFILE there is a good probability
you will do it again.
