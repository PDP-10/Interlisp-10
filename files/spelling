<LISP>SPELLING-CORRECTOR.INFO
Apr 13, 1975

the spelling corrector has been extended to permit specifying
a generator function instead of a spelling list.
this is done by calling fixspell or chooz with the
value of splst an array (of any size). The first element
of the array is the function which is called with the
array itself as a single argument. the function can then
use the remainder of the array to store 'state' information.

for example, if you wanted to use as a spelling list
certain tokens on a file, you could
store the file position of the last place the
generator returned an element from in the second element
of the array. 

the 'spelling list' is considered to be exhausted when
it returns NIL (so you can't spelling correct to NIL.)

the values returned by the generator are the
candidates for respelling and can be atoms or strings.

note: fixspell only does one ELT, so that changing
the generator function by smashing the array wont
have any effect, though you could achieve the same
thing by having your generator check one of the
other elts in the array for information to affect
how it behaved, and that cell you could change
with effect.
