Helpsys knows about every item that appears in the index in the
INTERLISP manual. This includes variables, property names,
clisp operators, makefile options, edit commands, etc., as well
as phrases. For example,

    TELL ME ABOUT COROUTINES AND GENERATORS

will present information corresponding to the indicated topic.

At any point, the user can type MORE, causing Helpsys to display
additional information, one page at a time, starting from the
point it last left off. After each page, Helpsys will query the 
user with More? at which time the user can respond Y or N.

Helpsys provides spelling correction and completion, e.g.

    TELL ME ABOUT CLISP$FLG

will present the user with a list of all topics beginning with
the letters CLISP, and ending with the letters FLG. The user
can then select the topic by typing the corresponding
number.
