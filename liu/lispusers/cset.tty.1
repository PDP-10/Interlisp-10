This package checks source files against compiled files in a directory
and prompts you about whether you want to (RE)COMPILE the files which
need it. It compares the FILECREATED expressions, and determines
whether a BRECOMPILE with CHANGES will suffice or if it is necessary
to BCOMPL the file. 

CHECKSET(files defaultresponse)

files is a list of files.

defaultresponse should be either NIL (ask) or Y (default answer to ASKUSER).
