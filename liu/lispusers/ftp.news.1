Subject: new values for ACCESS accepted

ACCESS=LIST says to return a list of all file names which match
FILE, e.g.

FTP(PARC-MAXC2 <NETLISP>*.SAV LIST) 

returns a list of file names (think if it as a "remote" FILDIR).


ACCESS=DELETE says to delete the remote file (think of it
as a "remote" DELFILE).

Previous message not quite right. ACCESS=LIST returns a list of
elements, CAR of which is the file name.

CDR of each element is an optional a-list of property names
and values for each of the files.

(CDR is NIL for Arpanet calls to FTP).


Note that <lispusers>dir (soon to go into the system) interfaces
with FTP such that


DIR {SU-AI}FOO

(i.e. access across the net) works.
