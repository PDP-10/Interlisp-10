ARITHMAC

This file is for use with the DECL and NOBOX packages only in Interlisp-10.
(It works for Interlisp-D, but there is no advantage and things might
even slow down.)

It defines special binding and setting functions for the LARGEP and
FLOATP decltypes that optimize the code produced by the PDP-10
compiler in various ways.

It also removes run-time calls to FIX and FLOAT for arguments
whose run-time type is compile-time-determinable to already
by correct.
