SMARTARG

This file contains a redefinition of the function SMARTARGLIST
such that it never attempts to consult the manual for the
argument lists of SUBRs (i.e., it never calls HELPSYS). Instead
a table is used-- if the SWAPHASH package has previously been
loaded, it is a swapped hash array; otherwise the argument
lists are stored in a resident array.

This means things like interrupts on SUBRS, BREAKS, ?=,
etc. are all significantly faster. The list of subr arguments
which are supplied with the SMARTARG package were obtained
by calling the OLD version of SMARTARGLIST (which used the
manual) and therefore should be as accurate.
