LISTDOC

Contains a single function, LISTDOC, which helps in printing the
documentation for other <LISPUSERS> files.

(LISTDOC list-of-package-names) will generate a LIST command for
the .TTY files on <LISPUSERS> corresponding to the package names.
(LISTDOC NIL) will produce documentation listings for all currently documented
packages.

(LISTDOC single-file-name) is equivalent to (LISTDOC list-containing-
only-that-file-name).  E.g. LISTDOC(FOO) is equivalent to LISTDOC((FOO))
