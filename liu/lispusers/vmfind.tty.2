VMFIND finds the description of a function in the Interlisp
VM document by using FFILEPOS. There are two functions

VF fn	prints out information about fn if it can find it
VMORE() prints out next paragraph of the VM

e.g.

_VF OPENP

OPENP[...] ...




VMFIND requires the file VM.PUB to be on one of the directories
named in HELPSYSDIRLST (used also by HELPSYS to find the manual
files.)
