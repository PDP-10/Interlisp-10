WAKEUP simply arranges for the bell to ring (to wake you up) when input is
requested after Interlisp has not been listening to you for a while (anything
over 15 seconds).  It assumes that input is requested only through READ and
ASKUSER.  To change the wakeup message (default is one ctl-G) reset WakeUp.
To change the minimal amount of time after which a wakeup message is sent
reset WakeUpTime (in milliseconds).
