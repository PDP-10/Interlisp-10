The figures can be included (via copy-select) in Tedit documents to allow a mixture of text and graphics in the same document.  This documentation was produced using Sketch.A sketch consists of "sketch elements".  Sketch elements include text, lines, curves, boxes, circles and ellipses.  Each element has one or more positions (called control points) that determine its location, and a set of properties such as brush.  A sketch is viewed in one or more sketch windows that provide a region and scale.  Within a window, the sketch can be edited by adding or deleting elements, or by changing the locations of control points or the values of properties.         (NIL  ((.1  48.0 NIL)  (BOX  (128.0  144.0  96.0  32.0) 1))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (176.0 .  160.0)  ("a box")  1.0  (CENTER CENTER)  (HELVETICA 12)  ((156.0  153.0  40.0  13.0)) NIL))  ((.1  24.0 NIL)  (CIRCLE  (240.0 .  80.0)  (256.0 .  96.0)  (ROUND 1 7) NIL))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (240.0 .  80.0)  ("a"  "circle")  1.0  (CENTER BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 12)  ((236.0  83.0  9.0  13.0)  (220.0  70.0  41.0  13.0)) NIL))  ((0.0  24.0 NIL)  (OPENCURVE  ((176.0 .  144.0)  (176.0 .  128.0)  (208.0 .  112.0)  (224.0 .  96.0))  (ROUND 1 7) NIL  (NIL  (LINE 30  10.0))))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (192.0 .  32.0)  ("A sample sketch")  1.0  (CENTER BASELINE)  (TIMESROMAN 12  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((135.0  29.0  114.0  14.0)) NIL))  ((.1  96.0 NIL)  (BOX  (96.0  16.0  192.0  176.0) 1)))(0 0 347.0 196.0)1.016.0How to load SketchTo get Sketch into your Interlisp-D system, load the file SKETCH.DCOM.  This will in turn load several other support files (SKETCHEDIT, SKETCHOBJ, GRAPHZOOM). How to start and stop SketchA sketch window can be opened in several ways.  The most common method is by selecting Sketch from the background command menu.  This will prompt for a region and open an empty sketch window there.A sketch that is in a Tedit document can be edited by pressing the left button in it and selecting the Edit Sketch item from the menu that appears.  This will open a sketch window the same size as the sketch in the document.Also, the function SKETCHW.CREATE (described below) can be called. When you are finished with a sketch window, it can be closed.  If you have made changes to the sketch without saving them on a file, it will ask you to confirm the closing.  If the sketch window was created from a sketch in a Tedit document, you will be given a menu choice of whether or not the changes made to this window should be returned to the document.  (NIL  ((.05

Pressing the middle button again will stretch a line from the beginning point to the cursor.  This line will move until the middle button is released again.  More lines can be added by pressing the middle button.  Each line starts where the previous one ended.  To start a new series of lines, press either the left or the right mouse button.  (The series of lines will be reset when you select on of the menu command discussed below.)  The drawing of any line segment can be stopped by moving the mouse outside the window.  This does not start a new series of lines; moving back into the window and pressing the middle button will pick up where the last line ended.      	Sketch Editing MenuThe Sketch menu (shown in the second figure) provides commands to add elements other than text and lines and commands to modify existing elements.  In most cases, it will be visible at the right of the sketch window.  The menu can be closed by right buttoning in it and selecting close from the presented menu.  After you close it, or if it wasn't visible in the first place, it can be retrieved by depressing the middle mouse button in the title bar.  If more than one command is going to be executed, it is convenient to keep the menu visible.  This is achieved by selecting Fix Menu from the Sketch menu (see Fix Menu below).  Select commands with the left or middle mouse button.The standard Interlisp-D window command menu can be retrieved by pressing the right button while the cursor in the title bar of the window.  The Redisplay command is sometimes useful for cleaning up the display in the sketch window which may get "dirtied" when elements are deleted or moved.  The Shape command is used to change the size and shape of the sketch window.  The size of the sketch window determines the size a sketch occupies when it is inserted into a text document.Commands to add elements to the sketchThe following commands add different elements to the sketch.  After selecting one of these commands you will be prompted to specify where in the sketch window you want the new element to be.      $       0   0 %0 HR0 ȉR0 U0 Ԏ%0    0     to add a "text box", a box within which text flows.  Prompts for a region which becomes the box.  Whenever the caret is inside of a text box, the characters typed become part of the text within the box.  The text in a box is broken into lines that fit within the width of the box.  The justification properties of the text specify the position of the text within the box.  If a word in the text is wider than the box width, it spills over.  If there are more lines than fit in the height of the box, they spill over also.  The characters outside the box cannot be selected for editing.  The dimensions of the box are changed by using the Move  or Move Point command on either corner point of the box.	     

An element can be selected by placing the cursor within the square surrounding any of its points and clicking the left button.  A group of elements can be selected by moving the cursor to one corner of the group, pressing the left button, then while holding the left button down, sweeping to the opposite corner.  This will select all elements in the swept out area.  A selected element can be deselected when the left button is held down by also holding down the right button.  All visible parts of the sketch can be selected by clicking the left button twice in the same square.  The elements selected will be marked by having their control points blackened.  The move command also works on points as well as complete elements.  To select a point, place the cursor within the square surrounding that point and clicking the left button.  A second immediate click (double clicking) of the left button will select the element of which the point is a part.  A third click will select all visible parts of the sketch.             (NIL  ((.1  12.0 NIL)  (BOX  (181.0  88.0  8.0  24.0) 2))  ((.1  44.0 NIL)  (BOX  (173.0  40.0  56.0  88.0) 2))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (137.0 .  136.0)  ("Left only"  "selects")  1.0  (RIGHT BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 12)  ((74.0  139.0  63.0  13.0)  (85.0  126.0  52.0  13.0)) NIL))  ((.1  12.0 NIL)  (BOX  (197.0  88.0  8.0  24.0) 2))  ((.1  12.0 NIL)  (BOX  (213.0  88.0  8.0  24.0) 2))  ((.1  13.0 NIL)  (WIRE  ((204.0 .  137.0)  (204.0 .  150.0)  (224.0 .  150.0)) 1))  ((.1  32.0 NIL)  (WIRE  ((185.0 .  115.0)  (185.0 .  136.0)  (153.0 .  136.0)) 1))  ((.1  28.0 NIL)  (WIRE  ((188.0 .  115.0)  (198.0 .  137.0)  (210.0 .  137.0)  (216.0 .  115.0)) 1))  ((.05  12.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (234.0 .  149.0)  ("Left and Right"  "deselects")  1.0  (LEFT BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 12)  ((234.0  152.0  103.0  13.0)  (234.0  139.0  70.0  13.0)) NIL))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (197.0 .  16.0)  ("Mouse button functions during selection")  1.0  (CENTER BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 14  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((42.0  13.0  310.0  15.0)) NIL)))(0 0 372.6338 172.7987)1.1755018.0Commands that modify Sketch elementsDelete  deletes an element or group of elements.  Note that delete cancels the element not just one point.  All graphic objects are identified when delete is chosen, and the user must select the object(s) to be deleted using the protocol described above.  To cancel this selection before deleting, place the cursor outside the sketch window and click a mouse button.	Move  moves a selected control point, an element or a group of elements.   If a single point is selected (see the section entitled Sketch Element Selection), the cursor will change to       p1aAAa1p , and a new location for that point should be selected by pressing the left button.  To stop the move, select a point outside the sketch window.If an element or a group of elements is selected, an image of the selected elements will be shown on the screen and will follow the cursor until the left button is pressed and released.  When the button is released, the selected elements will be moved to the shown locations.  To stop the move, press the left button when the entire image is out of the window.  (Note: An image containing curves or ellipses may be clipped at the edges.  All of the displayed elements will be moved and redrawn when you let up the button.)                 (NIL  ((.05  12.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (128.0 .  8.0)  ("Move menu item showing submenu")  1.0  (CENTER BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 12  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((0.0  5.0  256.0  13.0)) NIL))  ((.1 4 NIL)  (SKIMAGEOBJ  {(BMOBJ.GETFN2)     U UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUfffffffffg          UUUUUUUUUUUUUU  | <     UUUUUUUUUUUUUU  f     3333333333  c     fffffffffg  c>>~>  UUUUUUUUUUUUUU  cccc  UUUUUUUUUUUUUU  cccc  3333333333  c    c```            fccc            |>>>                                                    ``         NNNNys         NdNys         NdNys         NdNys         NqNyr         `x         $L         $L         $L                       +         8          5         8     `     5              `     +         a+                  c5                 c 5            3     c+            c       c+            `>~c  c5            `csc  aq5            `cc3                +            `cc6                +            ccc                5            3cs                5            >~  s                        `  s                       `x                          `0  1 ??                   1133           `     m11111           3`     m?1111           c`     m0 1111           `~<~?> a1133           `sfsgc a 1            `cccc             5           `c>cc           1  5           ccfcc`              +           3cfcgc            c?c?>  UUUUUUUUUUUUUU                  UUUUUUUUUUUUUU               c                  >                      UUUUUUUUUUUUUU             UUUUUUUUUUUUUU                                         p 8   UUUUUUUUUUUUUU           'W$  UUUUUUUUUUUUUU           %"=H             '"%H             $R%T  UUUUUUUUUUUUUU           'R8  UUUUUUUUUUUUUU                                           UUUUUUUUUUUUUU                   UUUUUUUUUUUUUU                                                     UUUUUUUUUUUUUU               UUUUUUUUUUUUUU               }  (0.0  40.0  286.0  83.0)  1.0  (0 . 0))))(0 0 286.0 123.0)1.08.0The menu item for this command is followed by a gray triangle pointing to the right indicating a sub-menu (see figure).  To retrieve the sub-menu, press down the left button, slide the cursor to the right through the triangle, and select the desired sub-command.  When the desired item is found, release the button while over it.  If you wish to choose a different menu command, slide to the left and the submenu will be withdrawn.  The submenu commands for Move are:Move point  Moves a single control point.  Select the point to be moved by pressing the left button  and releasing it while the cursor is over it.  The control point underneath the cursor will be blackened while the left button is down.  When the button is released, the cursor will change to       p1aAAa1p.  Specify a new location for the selected control point by pressing the left button.  To stop the move, select a point outside the sketch window.  Points can also be moved with the main menu Move command.  This subcommand provides an easier method of selecting a point since it is not possible to mistakenly select the whole element.Move elements  Moves a element or collection of elements.  This command is the same as the main menu Move command except that single points can not be specified.  It provides an easier method of selecting an element since it is not possible to mistakenly select a single point.Move onto grid  Moves all of the control points of a selected element or elements onto the current grid.  This is useful aligning a  piece that is copied from another sketch that may have had a different grid.Copy  similar to Move except that it makes a copy of the selected elements in the new position. Note:  Copy, delete and move can also be accomplished by using copy selection, deletion selection and move selection.  Copy selection is done using the following steps:  First click any mouse button in the sketch window.  This makes sure you are "talking" to the sketch window.  (If you "talking" to someother window, the selected sketch elements will be copied into that other window.)  Next, hold down the "copy key." On Alto style keyboards, this is either SHIFT key; on Dandelion keyboards, it can be either SHIFT key or the COPY key.  With the "copy key" held down, press the left mouse button.  At this point, the selection control points will appear and you can use the method described above in the section "Sketch element selection" to select the elements you wish to copy.  The selected elements will have their control points shaded with gray.  When you have selected the right elements, release the mouse buttons, then release the "copy key".  At this point, you will be prompted with an image of the selected elements which you should move into place.  If you wish to stop "copy selection", move the cursor outside of the window with either button held down or place the image completely outside the sketch window. Deletion selection is similar.  The difference is that the "delete key" is held instead of the "copy key".  On Alto sytle keyboards, the "delete key" is the CTRL key; on Dandelion keyboards, it can be the PROPS key or the DELETE key.  During deletion selection, the control points of selected elements are marked with       x}og0o}x.Move selection is also similar.  For "move selection", both the "delete key" and the "copy key" are held down.  During move selection, the control points of selected elements are marked with           ~>.       Change  enables the user to change the properties of an element or collection of elements.  All graphic elements are identified when Change is chosen, and the user must select the elements to be changed.  After selecting the elements to change, you will be presented a menu of ways to change them.  The particular menu varies for different elements because each has different properties.  If in doubt, select the object you want to change and see what choices are offered.  Selecting outside of the offered menu will not change anything.  If the selection contains elements of different types, the offered change will be for the type that is first selected and the change will be made to any other selected elements to which it is applicable.  For example, if the first selected element is a line and you select LARGER, all of the selected lines, curves and boxes will be made larger. (NIL  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (192.0 .  16.0)  ("Menu offered for changing text elements")  1.0  (CENTER BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 12  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((44.0  13.0  297.0  13.0)) NIL))  ((.1 4 NIL)  (SKIMAGEOBJ  {(BMOBJ.GETFN2)        | vߊs;Nt㝼 ymo-o| _mn6 mom~ {slV                                                            0Ǐ      `l͌       ͌            ` ̀      0l͌      l                                                                      lq            l    0      `    0     ϟ>~|π   lcc0lf    lcc0lf    lc0lf    l`c0lf    lcc0lf    >cc                                                                         8             `           `      >ϟ      6f c     30f c     33 c     6f c     6f c     33Ϙ a                                                                    |a   3q    6q    6y    y    6=m    6m    6g    l3g    l1|c                                                                                                     ?> ~|     1     =1    1     1 ;0    1`     p1 ~|                                                                        >           3           30l`           30l`           ?0l`           1l`           1l`           1l`           1           ?߀                                                                                                                 ?          c          c          c          c          c          ?                                                                                                                 π           f           f                        f           f           sπ                                                                          `           `          `           oπ         llf         llf          ll          llf         lf         lsπ                                                                             `  c          ` f                  ϟ> lgo   llf1 llf1   lf1 lnf   f? lgf    lf00 laf    llf1 llf    c0 gf           `                6                                               0  c0         0   `0        >}c<}       c0cfc1       c0cpc0       0c<c0       `0cc0X       c0cfc0x       >0p?<;00              0                                                         `           `                   gπd      llf 3d      llf d      llf       llf s      llf 3      gcف        `            `  p                                                     c0             `0       c<}       60cfc1       60cpc0       60c<c0       60cc0X       60cfc0x       s?<;00             0                                                            0         0         | `   13`   1`   1   1s   13   ف                       p                                       ``l           ``l           `l         g >c    3llm ٘c    3llm 3    3llm 6    3llm Ø    3llm ٘    3g                            l               8                                    c0           `0    xxc<}   ͍60cfc1   ፶60cpc0   |y7c<c0   6 cc0X   ͍60cfc0x   vx3?<;00              0                               }  (112.0  40.0  142.0  240.0)  1.0  (0 . 0))))(0 0 340.0 284.0)1.08.0 	Text  enables the user to change the font, size, and face of the text as well as the alignment of the text relative to its position.  The menu commands are as follows:Look same  enables the user to make all of a collection of text look alike.   It makes all of the selected text items be the same font size, face, and alignment as the first selected item.  This changes the selected text items only.  It is convenient for making text that was entered at different scales look the same.different font  enables the user to change the type of the font.  The user will be offered a menu of the previously entered font families and the item other.  If the item other is selected, you will be prompted for the name of a font family.  If the selected or named font is not available in the size of the first selected text element,  an error message is printed and nothing is changed.  If an appropriately sized font is found, any of the selected text elements that have the same size as the first selected text element will be changed to the new font.  The search for fonts will encompass any directories on DISPLAYFONTDIRECTORIES and may take a few minutes.  For PRESS fonts, there is no way of determining what sizes of a given font exist.  Sketch will try to create sizes 8, 10 and 12 in new fonts.  If it doesn't find a font that you believe exists, you can make that font the default font (both family and size) and retry the change. Font size control:	Smaller font, Larger font, Set font sizeFont face control:	Bold, unbold, Italic, UnItalicThe relationship between the text and its control point is determined by the horizontal and vertical alignment properties. Horizontal alignment:

If that end doesn't have an arrowhead, nothing happens.Wider  increases the angle of the arrowhead with respect to the line.Narrower  decreases the angle of the arrowhead with respect to the line.Larger  increases the length of the side of the arrowhead.Smaller  decreases the length of the side of the arrowhead.V shape  changes the shape of the arrowhead to be two sides.Triangle  changes the shape of the arrowhead to be two sides and a base.            (NIL  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (168.0 .  4.0)  ("Sample arrowheads")  1.0  (CENTER BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 12  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((96.0  1.0  145.0  13.0)) NIL))  ((.1  56.0 NIL)  (WIRE  ((48.0 .  84.0)  (104.0 .  68.0)) 1  (NIL  (CLOSEDLINE 60  16.0))))  ((.1  56.0 NIL)  (WIRE  ((48.0 .  100.0)  (104.0 .  100.0)) 1  (NIL  (LINE 30  10.0))))  ((.1  56.0 NIL)  (WIRE  ((48.0 .  36.0)  (104.0 .  36.0)) 1  ((LINE  30.0  12.0)  (LINE 150  8.0)) NIL))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (120.0 .  100.0)  ("size: 10, angle: 30, v shape, on right ")  1.0  (LEFT BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 10  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((120.0  98.0  217.0  12.0)) NIL))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (120.0 .  68.0)  ("size: 16, angle: 60, triangle shape, on right ")  1.0  (LEFT BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 10  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((120.0  66.0  255.0  12.0)) NIL))  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (120.0 .  32.0)  ("size: 8, angle: 150, v shape, on right, and"  "size: 12, angle: 30, v shape, on left ")  1.0  (LEFT BASELINE)  (HELVETICA 10  (MEDIUM REGULAR REGULAR))  ((120.0  36.0  244.0  12.0)  (120.0  24.0  207.0  12.0)) NIL))  ((.1  154.0 NIL)  (BOX  (28.0  20.0  308.0  92.0) 1)))(0 0 370.0 114.0)1.04.0Shape  same menus will be given as for Curves.Size  same menus will be given as for Curves.Note: if you are entering many arrowheads, it is convenient to set the properties of the default arrowhead using the Defaults command before adding the arrows.Lines  change enables the user to change the arrowhead characteristics and the size in the same manner as Open Curves.Boxes  change enables the user to change the line thickness in the same manner as changing the brush size of Curves.Text boxes  change enables the user to change the line thickness of the box in the same manner as changing the brush size of Curves or the properties of the text as in Text.	Other Sketch commandsGroup  collects a group of elements together.  After the elements are grouped, they will have a single control point which is at their center.  This is sometimes convenient to reduce the number of control points in a diagram or to more easily duplicate common parts of a figure.  The elements in a group are moved, copied, deleted and changed together.  If you want to change just one piece of a group, you must UnGroup it first.  Groups can be included in other groups.UnGroup  restores the first selected group to its individual elements.  Undo  to undo a previous command.  Selecting this command will bring up a menu of past commands.  Select the command which you wish to have undone.  The most recent event is placed at the top of the menu.  To cancel this command, click the button with the cursor outside the menu.  In the menu,  "Wire" refers to lines.  If the same graphical element has been changed more than once, the changes to it must be undone in the reverse order in which they were done.The number of changes that are remembered is determined by the variable SKETCH.#.UNDO.ITEMS and is initially set to 30.  If you which to save more or less changes, you can set SKETCH.#.UNDO.ITEMS to a larger or smaller number.  To change it to 50, for example, type (SETQ SKETCH.#.UNDO.ITEMS 50) into the "Top level typescript window".  Defaults   enables the user to change the default brush, text, text box and arrowhead characteristics.  The default characteristics are the properties given to newly added lines, text or arrowheads.

To retrieve the sub-menu, press down the left button, slide the cursor to the right through the triangle, and select the desired sub-command before releasing the button.  Continue holding the button and slide through the desired sub-menu item to obtain the sub-sub-menus.  When the desired item is found, release the button while over it.  If you wish to choose a different item from a higher level menu, slide to the left and the submenus will be withdrawn.Line  enables the user to change the default line size.  A pad of numbers is displayed from which the user chooses the size and clicks OK to exit.  If the brush size is not to change, select OK when the size is 0 to cancel the command.A sub-menu allows the user to change the default brush shape or size.	Shape  enables the user to change the brush shape.  The most recent change becomes the default for all new elements created.  Choose from the following sub-menu:	Round, Square, Vertical, Horizontal, DiagonalSize  same as Line above.Add Arrowhead  enables the user to set whether or not newly added open lines and curves get arrowheads on either or both ends.  After selecting this item, you will be given a menu of the following choices from which you can pick one or click outside, if you don't want to make any change.	First, Last, Both, Neither, Left, RightArrowhead  enables the user to change the default arrowhead size.  A pad of numbers is displayed from which the user chooses the arrowhead size and clicks OK to exit.  If the arrowhead size is not to change, select OK when the size is 0 to cancel the command.  The arrowhead size is given in screen points.  When the arrowhead is added, the screen point size is scaled to get its real sketch size.  This size is then scaled as the line or curve scales.A sub-menu allows the user to change the default arrowhead size, angle and type.	Size  same as Arrowhead above.Angle  enables the user to change the angle of the default arrowhead.  A pad of numbers is displayed from which the user chooses the angle in degrees.  If the arrowhead angle is not to change, select OK when the size is 0 to cancel the command	.Type  enables the user to change the type of the default arrowhead.  A menu of type is displayed from which the user chooses the new default.  Currently there are two types:  V-shape  the arrowhead consists of two lines from the head and  Triangle  the arrowhead consists of a triangle (two lines from the head and a line connecting their endpoints.)Text  enables the user to change the size of new text.  A menu of the known font sizes is displayed from which the user chooses the size.  Note: not all fonts are available in all sizes.   The sub-menu allows the user to change the size, face and alignment properties of new text.	Size  same as Text above.Font  enables the user to change the font family property of new text.  The user specifies a font family using the same method as when the font property of text is changed (described under the change command).  If the specified font can not be found in the current default size, an error message is printed and the default is not changed.Horizontal alignment  enables the user to change the horizontal alignment property of new text.  The choices are:Center, Left, RightVertical alignment  enables the user to change the vertical alignment property of new text.  A menu of alignments is displayed from which the user chooses the new default. The choices are:Top, Center, Baseline, BottomLooks  enables the user to change the face property of new text.  A menu of faces is displayed from which the user chooses the new default. The choices are:regular, bold, italic, bold/italicText Box  enables the user to change the horizontal alignment of text within new text boxes.  The default of text boxes is different from the default for text.  Its initial setting is Center.  The sub-menu allows the user to change the horizontal and vertical alignment properties of new text boxes.	Horizontal alignment  enables the user to change the horizontal alignment property of text within new text boxes.  The choices are:Center, Left, RightVertical alignment  enables the user to change the vertical alignment property of text within new text boxes.  A menu of alignments is displayed from which the user chooses the new default. The choices are:Top, Center, Baseline, BottomGrid  displays and changes the grid which determines where points can be positioned on the display.  When the grid is on, only points on the corners of the grid can be specified for any sketch operations.  This makes it much easier to align parts of the sketch.  The default is to have a grid turned on with a default grid size of about half centimeter.  If the grid is off, any point can be selected.  The main menu Grid item flips back and forth between using and not using the grid.  Submenu items are available to display the grid and to change its size.  The grid is always on a power of two in the sketch coordinate space.  This means that same points are accessible on the grid as the sketch scale changes.             (NIL  ((.05  13.0 NIL)  (TEXT  (186.0 .  8.0)  ("Sketch window with default grid displayed")  1.0

The submenu commands are:Turn grid ON  while the grid is ON, any points selected are on the grid.Turn grid OFF  while the grid is OFF, any point can be selected.LARGER grid  doubles the space between the grid pointssmaller grid  halves the space between the grid points.Display grid  will display a point at each point on the grid.  If the grid points are closer than 3 points together, they are not shown; instead, a message giving the number of screen points per grid point is displayed in the status window above the sketch window.  If the grid points are a large distance apart, a message indicating how far apart the grid points are is displayed also.  Remove grid display  will remove the grid display.Move view  changes the portion of the sketch that is visible in the window.  The user specifies the new portion of the sketch that will appear in the window by depressing any mouse button at one corner and sweeping the cursor to the other corner (see next figure).  The specified region will be outlined in gray.  When the button is released, the portion of the sketch within the gray box will be scaled to fill the sketch window.  The box will maintain the same aspect ratio as the window.  The section may be smaller or larger than the current window size.  This command can be cancelled by typing control-E.  (Note: the sketch can be scrolled either horizontally or vertically using the standard Interlisp-D scroll bars at the left and bottom of the window.)  Use the subitem Home to return the sketch to its original form.(NIL  ((.1 4 NIL)  (SKIMAGEOBJ  {(BMOBJ.GETFN2)    k t 㻎8Αݷu]m[ouYjouooݻuwqٟ㽎0c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               R       R                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 UUUUP       t           

To retrieve the sub-menu, slide the cursor to the right through the triangle, and select the desired sub-command before releasing the button.  The sub-menu gives the user other ways to change the view on the sketch.Zoom  does the same action as Move view.	AutoZoom  changes the scale around a selected point.  Holding the left button down will zoom in toward the cursor.  Pressing the middle button will zoom out from the cursor.  The amount of each scale jump is determined by the global variable AUTOZOOM.FACTOR and is initially .8. Holding either button down will zoom continuously in the appropriate direction.  Use Home to return the sketch to its original form.  Press any button outside the window to stop autozoom mode.	Home  returns the user to a view at scale of 1.0 which has the origin in the lower left corner.  This is useful if you lose the sketch after scrolling or using Zoom or AutoZoom.	Locator  puts up a small window that displays the cursor's location in sketch coordinates whenever the cursor is inside the sketch window.	New window  opens another window onto the same sketch.  The second window can be scrolled or zoomed without affecting the view in the original window.    This allows one window to act as an overview while the other can be used to blow up an intricate part of the sketch and make detailed changes.  Any changes made to either of the windows are reflected in both windows.Hardcopy  sends the image in the window to the DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST.  The image will be centered in the page.  Hardcopy has a submenu that can change the display to hardcopy mode or makes a printer file of the current view of the sketch in either press or interpress format, and, optionally, sends it to the printer.  Each of the subcommands has subitems that allow the choice of Press or Interpress.  If the submenu is not used to specify the print format type, the type appropriate for the first entry on DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST is used.  The subcommands are:File Only   Prompts for a file name and makes an image on it.Print Only  Prints the image but doesn't save the file.File & Print  Prompts for a file name, makes an image on it and print the image on DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST.Hardcopy Display  Displays the text in the window as close as possible to the way it will look when printed.  Text fonts have significantly different widths on the display and on the PRESS printer.   Normal Display  Displays the text in a way more easily read and edited on the screen.Put  Saves the sketch on a file.  The sketch can be retrieved by the Get command.  Sketches can also be saved by including them in Tedit documents (see below).Get  Retrieves a sketch from a file.  Any elements in the window before the Get will still be there.Fix Menu  (appears in the pop up menu only) fixes menu to the right edge of the sketch window.  Including image objects in a sketchOther Interlisp-D image objects (such as bitmaps) can be placed in sketches by using the standard copy-select mechanism.  For example, to include a bitmap image,  hold down the "copy select" key, move the cursor into the background, press the right button and select SNAP from the offered menu.  Select the region of the screen to be included, move the cursor back into the sketch window and place the bitmap image (which should now be following the cursor) in place.  (Note: image objects do not scale.)Image objects in sketches can be "moved", "copied" and  "deleted" like an other elements.  Calling "change" on an image object or pressing a button down while over its image in the sketch window will call that objects BUTTONEVENTINFN which is often an editor for the object.Putting sketches into Tedit documentsSketches can be included in documents by copy-selection.  Select the location in the document where the sketch is to go.  Hold down the 'copy select' key.  Move the cursor into the sketch window and select the pieces of the sketch to be inserted.  The whole sketch can be selected by double clicking on a sketch element.  While selecting pieces, the right button will remove elements from the selection.  When the desired elements have been selected, release the 'copy select' key.  The sketch will be inserted into the document.  The sketch will be the size of the window from which it is copied.  To change its shape,  reshape the sketch window.  The copy selection process can be aborted by moving the cursor outside of the sketch window while a button is down. The sketch will be adjusted so that the lower left corner of the inserted sketch is on a grid point.  This is done so the when the sketch is edited, the grid remains aligned with existing points.  The grid can be made smaller before the copy insertion to reduce the amount of adjustment.Note:  Current implementation limitation, TEdit will only display the sketch if the Tedit window is at least as tall as the sketch.  NOTE:  For now, you must have SKETCH loaded in order to edit or look at a TEdit document that has a sketch object in it.  If SKETCH isn't loaded, TEDIT will break with an undefined function SKIO.GETFN.  From the break window, load SKETCH and type OK into the break window.)A sketch that is in a document can be edited by pressing the left button inside it and selecting the offered menu item Edit sketch.  This will prompt for a position of a sketch window the same size as the sketch.  In this window, the sketch can be edited, scrolled, zoomed, etc.  A sketch so edited may contain elements that are not visible in the printed document.  These elements can be exposed by zooming or scrolling.  When the window is closed, you will be offered a chance to place the sketch back into the document.  If accepted, the current view of the sketch will be placed into the document.   The  sketch window will have the menu already fixed beside it.Copying from one sketch to anotherParts of a sketch can be copied from one sketch to another using a protocol similar to the above.  Select the target sketch.  Hold down the 'copy select' key.  Move into the source window and select the desired elements using the left and right button protocol described earlier.  When the 'copy select' key is released, position the cursor back in the target window.  You will be dragging an image of the selected elements that can be placed in the target by pressing and releasing the left button.  For now, the scale of the transferred elements is not changed so the image in the new window may be a different size after the transfer.Copying the text out of a Sketch as charactersThe text characters in a sketch (i.e. text and text box elements) can be copied from a sketch by using the selection procedure described above but selecting elements with the middle button instead of the left one.  When the 'copy select' key is released, the characters in selected text and text box elements will be copied.Sketch Implementation NotesSKETCHW.CREATE (SKETCH SKETCHREGION SCREENREGION  TITLE INITIALSCALE BRINGUPMENUFLG INITIALGRID)Opens a sketch window onto the sketch SKETCH.  SKETCH can be: NIL, an empty sketch is generated and given a name; a sketch; or the name of a sketch. SKETCHREGION, if given, is a region in sketch coordinates of the part of the sketch to be initially displayed.  SCREENREGION can be: a region, the screen region to be used for the sketch window; or a window to be used as the sketch window.  TITLE will be used as the title of the sketch window.  If TITLE is NIL, the title "Viewer onto 'SketchName'" is used.  INITIALSCALE if a number will be the initial scale of the sketch; 1.0 is the default.  If BRINGUPMENUFLG is non-NIL, the sketch operations menu will be brought up beside the right edge of the window.  INITIALGRID  indicates whether or not to use a grid.  If it is a number, the grid will be set to the least power of 2 greater than INITIALGRID.  If INITIALGRID is T, the grid will be set to allow approximately half a centimeter between grid points.  If it is NIL, no grid will be used.BRINGUPMENUFLG can be a menu in which case it is brought up beside the right edge of the window.  The standard sketch command menu is the SKETCHPOPUPMENU property of the window.EDITSLIDE(SKETCH) Opens a window the size of a sheet of 8.5 by 11 piece of paper.  This is useful for laying out slides or other full page images.Programming NotesIf a sketch window has a non-NIL value for the property DONTQUERYCHANGES, the user will not be asked to confirm the close even though changes have occurred.         $                                               T                                                     6 <                       $ 6                       6 <                       $ *                                                                                                  $                        B B                       < H                       < <                       * *                                                  * *                        * *                       * 6                                                                                                                                                                                                   T                         T                                                                                        	HELVETICA 
