This package checks source files against compiled files in a directoryand prompts you about whether you want to (RE)COMPILE the files whichneed it. It compares the FILECREATED expressions, and determineswhether a BRECOMPILE with CHANGES will suffice or if it is necessaryto BCOMPL the file. (CHECKSET FILES COMPFLG)FILES is a list of files. If FILES is NIL, CHECKSET is driven by the variableFILESETS.COMPFLG can be:	N		don't compile, just return list. List can			be passed to COMPFILES.	Y or NIL	compile	ASK		ask, for each file, whether to compile it.FILESETS	[variable]Used by (CHECKSET NIL): FILESETS is a list of variables, each ofwhich has a value which is a list of files. (CHECKSET NIL) peforms(for X in FILESETS join (CHECKSET (EVALV X))). For example,if FILESETS = (0LISPSET 1LISPSET) and 0LISPSET = (ATERM LLREAD BREAK), 1LISPSET = (WINDOW EDIT)then (CHECKSET) will will check if each of those files in turnneed recompiling.(COMPFILES lst)	[function]takes a list of elements of the form (RECOMPILE file) (COMPILE file)as returned by CHECKSET with COMPFLG=N and performs the correspondingoperation.Comment:The user interface for this package is terrible, with CHECKSETeither doing it or returning a list via a FLG.  Shame on us.Larry Masinter
