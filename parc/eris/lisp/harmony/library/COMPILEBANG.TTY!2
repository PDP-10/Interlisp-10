COMPILEBANGThis provides an interface to the compiler that avoids the interviewfor the common cases of in-core compilation.It contains a single function COMPILE!, and the Lispx and edit macros C:COMPILE![X;NOSAVE;NOREDEFINE;PRINTLAP]	Calls the compiler to compile X.  If X is a litatom, its 	definition is compiled and stored in the function cell unless	NOREDEFINE, and the old definition if any is saved on the	property list unless NOSAVE.  No printing of lap or machine code	is done unless PRINTLAP.	Thus, to simply compile the function BAR, do COMPILE!(BAR).	X may also be a list form.  In this case, COMPILE! assumes that	the user is interested just in seeing how that form would	compile.  The form is embedded in a Lambda expression and compiled.     Of course, there is no function-cell to be	stored into or saved.The LISPXMACRO C calls COMPILE!, with PRINTLAP on, on the next element of the input line.  Thus,	_C BARwill compile, redefine, and save the old definition for BAR.	_C (CONS)will show how a call to CONS would compile.The editmacro C calls COMPILE! on the current expression if it is a list, oron the form of which the current expression is an element.Comments to Ron Kaplan
