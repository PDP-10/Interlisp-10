Any plans for a similar sheet this year?Also, any copies around of Demo scripts?  I usually do the ExpertDemofrom memory, and it's rather different (shall we say unique?) each time.Not sure I'll be giving it ... but the script that John preparedlast year was of some help.*start*01739 00024 USmDate: Mon, 15 Aug 83 11:38 PDTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: Booth duty (Revision 5)To: aaai&uarr;.eosReply-to: Raim.pasa===========================================================Monday, August 228	Raim		Stansbury	9	Raim		Gadol		Stansbury10	Raim		Vittal		Gadol11	Raim		Sheil		Vittal12	Vittal		Martin	Sheil1	Martin	Purcell	Russell2	Raim		Russell	Vittal3	Raim		Russell	Stansbury4	Raim		Sheil		Gadol--------------------------------------------------------------Tuesday, August 238	Martin	Stansbury	9	Vittal		Gadol		Stansbury10	Vittal		Russell	Gadol11	Vittal		Sheil		Stansbury12	Sheil		Martin	Stansbury1	Raim		Purcell	Russell2	Raim		White		Vittal3	Raim		White		Stansbury4	Raim		Sheil		Gadol--------------------------------------------------------------Wednesday, August 248	Raim		Martin	9	Raim		Martin	White10	Vittal		White		Gadol11	Vittal		Sheil		White12	Sheil		Martin	Stansbury1	Raim		Purcell	Russell2	Raim		Russell	Vittal3	Raim		White		Stansbury4	Raim		Sheil		Gadol--------------------------------------------------------------Thursday, August 258	Vittal		Gadol	9	Vittal		Gadol		Stansbury10	Raim		White		Sheil11	Raim		White		Sheil12	Stansbury	Martin	Purcell1	Raim		Purcell	Russell2	3		Truckin' competition -- Everybody available4	--------------------------------------------------------------Friday, August 268	Vittal		Stansbury	9	Vittal		White		Purcell10	Raim		White		Sheil11	Raim		Gadol		Sheil12	Stansbury	Martin	Purcell1	Russell	Purcell	Martin2	Raim		Martin3	Raim		Agadoni4	Raim		Agadoni5	Raim		Agadoni6	Raim		Agadoni7	Raim		Agadoni------------------------------------------------------------*start*01574 00024 USmDate: Mon, 15 Aug 83 11:40 PDTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: aaai demo schedule (Revision 7)To: aaai&uarr;.eosReply-to: Raim.pasa--------------------------------------------------------------Monday, August 228 -

We have prepared cards to invite people to the suite.  A host will be appointed each night. The host's responsibility is to greet people as they arrive, and make sure that they are introduced to a Xerox person.  The host will be there as long as the suite is open.  John Hajgato will handle all of the logistics.All of the designated marketing and as many as possible of the technical people are expected to be in the suite  each night to assist in answering questions and entertaining the customers.  The marketing people will arrange to take key customers out to dinner.If it is necessary to set up a meeting with a key customer during the day, I will arrange to open the suite.A Sony Betamax 3/4 inch video tape player will be available in the suite.All of the participants in the show are invited to attend a meeting in the hospitality suite at 8:00 pm on Sunday.  This will give all of us a chance to get acquainted with one another, and to review the procedures during the show.The following are the Hospitality suite assignments:		Sun		Mon		Tues 		Wed 		ThurHost		Bomeisler	McGoldrick	Davis		Runge	MoranMarketing	Moran	Moran	Moran	Moran				Runge	Runge	Runge			Runge								Davis				McGehee	McGehee	McGehee	McGehee				Gallo		Gallo		Gallo		McGoldrick			McGoldrick		DEMONSTRATION SCHEDULEThis is the final version of the demo schedule.
