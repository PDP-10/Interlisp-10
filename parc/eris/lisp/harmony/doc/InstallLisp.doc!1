InstallLisp.doc --- Lichtenberg 31-Jul-84 14:08:21InstallLisp.bcd (from {Eris}<Lisp>Harmony>Mesa>) allows the installation & starting of lisp sysouts from Tajo pilot volumes, Pup file servers, and NS file servers.  It is a modification of the ex-hack Install.bcd, which is used to install pilot boot files (e.g., TajoDlion.boot, etc.)  This new program runs in the Tajo Executive (you need Tajo or CoPilot), and has the following command syntax:	> InstallLisp volumeName _ fileName/switches	volumeName is the name of the volume that you want the Lisp installed onfileName is the name of the source file, which may include a host name.  Examples:	Lisp.sysout  (local Tajo disk)	<Copilot>Lisp.sysout (a different local volume, provided it's opened)	[Eris]<Lispcore>Next>Full.sysout (Pup file server)	[StarFile:PARC:Xerox]<Lisp>Current>Full.Sysout (NS File server)switches may be one or more of the following:      /d - set to default boot-lisp (the lisp that will be run when 0-booted)      /s - start the lisp after installation      /x - expand file to fill volume      To combine switches, do not duplicate the slashes.  (to specify all switches, use /dsx).An alternative command format,        > InstallLisp volumeName/switchesallows one to apply the switches to the file that is already on a volume.  For example, to start lisp on Lisp4 type InstallLisp Lisp4/s.
