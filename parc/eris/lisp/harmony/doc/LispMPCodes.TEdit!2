Maintenance Panel Error Code Summary for Xerox 1108 Interlisp-D There are two types of maintenance panel codes: progress codes and error codes.  Progress codes are placed in the Maintenance Panel at various stages of initialization.  Error codes are traps which freeze or blink the error number in the maintenance panel.  All errors except the 9000-range errors are fatal.Summary of MP code ranges0000-0499 boot-time diagnostics0500-0699 IOP code0700-0899 Pilot microcode0900-0999 Pilot1000-6999 tech-rep diagnostics7000-8887 Star8888-8888 MP lamp test9000-9999 LispBoot-time errors0096	Insufficient real memory (<1MByte) for lisp0149	Usually right after power-on.

Will hang in this state if non-Lisp code tries to perform Pup operations and no Pup ID Server responds.9000-9299 DLion Interlisp-D microcode error detectedMost of these errors are indicative of some serious problem, probably hardware, and usually fatal (but try ^D if you can't TeleRaid).  The main exception is 9004see description of code 9304.9001	CSParErr	Control store parity error9002	StackErr	hardware stack overflow9003	IBEmptyErr	instruction fetch unit empty error9004	VirtAddrErr	Attempt to reference virtual address >22 bits9005	EmuMemErr	double bit memory error or non-existent memory9009	CAR/CDR	bad pointer9013	NegPcError	inconsistent PC at FnCall9014	applyUfn	arg to apply not integer9016	notFreeTrap	stack allocation error9024	Page fault in the page fault handler.9051	BadUfnTable 9120	MiscErr Output	opcode no such register9121	MiscErr	opcode bad 2nd byte9122	MiscErr Input	opcode no such register9126	PcNegError	inconsistent PC at Punt9300-9399 Lisp system code error (call to \MP.ERROR)These codes generally indicate an error state in Lisp system code that cannot be handled in the break package.  Most are "should never happen" cases that indicate a serious error; but some (in particular, 9305 and 9318) may be much less serious.  If possible, use TeleRaid to find out more information (press the Undo key to enter the TeleRaid server (cursor changes into "TeleRaid"), and run the TeleRaid user from another machine).  Even if you can't TeleRaid from another machine, several of these codes you can convert into a Lisp break if the world is still mostly consistent and the error occurred under user code (rather than, say, the garbage collector): type ^B to the TeleRaid server.  Summary of TeleRaid server commands:^B	attempt to enter Break.  If error is in a special system context, will change cursor to "CANT", indicating refusal to enter break. ^D	perform Hard Resetclear stack, flush all non-restartable processes.^N	continue from error.  This is usually not possible, except for code 9318, or when you got a 9915 error by typing ^C while the Raid interrupt was enabled.^P	display Pup host number (in decimal) in maintenance panel.9302	Invalid Vmem: attempt to boot an image that is not a valid Lisp sysout, or which is inconsistent from having some, but not all, of its dirty pages written.  Can happen if you boot instead of calling LOGOUT.  Usually caught sooner as code 217.9303	"No place for IOCB page at startup"should never happen.9304	Map out of bounds: attempt to use a pointer larger than the virtual address space of the machine.  Usually means garbage was fetched from somewhere that should have contained a pointer.  This usually appears as code 9004 instead. 9305	Invalid address: attempt to use a pointer that does not refer to an existing (allocated) part of virtual memory.  Usually means garbage was fetched from somewhere that should have contained a pointer.  This error can often be converted to a break with the ^B TeleRaid command.9306	Invalid virtual page.  Usually caught sooner, as a 9004. 9307	"Unavailable page on real page chain"inconsistent state in page fault handler.9308	"Loop in \SELECTREALPAGE"inconsistent state in page fault handler.9309	Attempt to allocate already existing page (from call to \NEWPAGE).9310	"\DONEWPAGE failed to allocate new map page"9311	"Locked page occupies a file page needed to lock another"bad state in virtual memory system.9312	Arg to CLOCK0 not an integer box.9313	Fault on resident page: processor took a page fault for a page that appears to be resident.9314	PageFault on stack: shouldn't happen, as stack is resident.9316	Attempt to extend vmem beyond 8MB (can only happen if running with VMEM.PURE.STATE on).9317	Attempt to write a locked page when not under \FLUSHVMbad state in virtual memory system.9318	Error in uninterruptable system code: an error that ordinarily would enter a break (e.g., a type test failure), but in a piece of code that should not be user-interruptable.  This is generally a sign that some datum used by system code has been smashed, but this is not always fatal.  Should you not have a wizard handy to diagnose the error with TeleRaid, you can type ^N after entering the TeleRaid server; Lisp will go ahead and attempt to enter a the break anyway, from which (if it succeeds) you might be able to glean more information about the problem.9319	Stack full: hard stack overflow.  A soft stack overflow (Lisp break "STACK FULL") occurs when the stack is mostly used up; if you proceed beyond that point without resetting you can completely fill the stack and get this MP code.  Press STOP to perform a HARDRESET to clear the stack, or run TeleRaid to find out who was guilty of overflowing the stack.9320	MDS full: the space for allocation of fixed-length objects is completely exhausted.  A continuable Lisp break "STORAGE FULL" occurs when MDS is nearly full.9321	Unknown UFN: attempt to execute an unimplemented opcode.  This usually means that the processor is trying to execute random memory, or took a wild jump somewhere.  Often a microcode bug.9322	Atoms full: the limit on number of litatoms (2^15) has been reached.9323	Pnames full: there is no more space for storing the pnames of litatoms.  This is unlikely to occur unless you create an extraordinary number of litatoms that have very long pnames.9324	Stack frame use count overflow: the program has attempted to create more than 200 references to the same stack frame.9325	MDS nearly full: this is a warning that comes later than the "STORAGE FULL" break but before you completely run out (and get a 9320).  You can continue from this error with ^N from TeleRaid.9326	Bad MDS free list: the free list of recycled MDS pages got trashed.  You can continue from this error with ^N from TeleRaid.9327	Bad array block.  The array allocator found a bad array block in its free list.  Generally means some unsafe code trashed one or more locations in array space.9328	A variation on 9327.9329	The garbage collector attempted to reclaim an array block, but the block's header was trashed.  You can continue from this error with ^N from TeleRaid, but it is symptomatic of array trashing, and you should save your state as soon as possible and restart in a good sysout.9400-9899 unassigned9900-9924 Attempt to call Raid or Alto O.S. (BCPL Subr).The only one that is likely to ever occur is 9915, call to RAID.  Note that if you have the Raid interrupt enabled (by default on ^C), you will get a 9915 error by typing that interrupt character.9905	NOOPSUBR9906	\BACKGROUNDSUBR9907	\CHECKBCPLPASSWORD9908	DISKPARTITION9909	DSPBOUT9910	\DSPRATE9911	\GATHERSTATS9912	\GETPACKETBUFFER 9913	\LISPFINISH9914	\MOREVMEMFILE9915	RAID9916	\READRAWPBI9917	\WRITERAWPBI9918	SETSCREENCOLOR9919	SHOWDISPLAY9920	\PUPLEVEL1STATE9921	\WRITESTATS9922	\CONTEXTSWITCH9923	\COPYSYS0SUBR9924	\WRITEMAP         Ô             NIL NIL           A   
