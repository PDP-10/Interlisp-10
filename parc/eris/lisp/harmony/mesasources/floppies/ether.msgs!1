515	1"Following describes the semantic of each statistic displayed	echoServerPkts:	Indicates the number of packets that the machine has echoed.	echoServerBytes:  Indicates the number of bytes that the machine has echoed.	packetsRecv:  Indicates the total number of packets that have been successfully received, including echo packets.	wordsRecv:  Indicates the total number of words that have been successfully received, including words in echo packets.	packetsMissed:  Indicates the number of packets that have been dropped for lack of buffering.	badRecvStatus:  Indicates the total number of packets that were not successfully received.	okButDribble:  Indicates the total number of packets that were successfully received, but had extra bits at the end.	badCrc:  Indicates the number of packets that were received with bad CRCs.		badAlignmentButOkCrc: Indicates the number of packets that were received with correct CRCs, but did not end on byte boundaries.	crcAndBadAlignment:  Indicates the number of packets that were received with bad CRCs and did not end on byte boundaries.	packetTooLong: Indicates the number of packets received that were long than the maximum internet size of 576 bytes.	overrun:  Occurs when the microcode cannot take bits out of the input silo fast enough to keep up with the bits coming in of the wire.		idleInput:  Indicates the number of bytes that the machine has echoed.	packetsSent:  Indicates the total number of packets that have been successfully sent, including echo packets.	wordsSent:  Indicates the number of words sent, including those in echo packets.	badSendStatus:  Indicates the total number of packets that were not successfully sent.	tooManyCollisions: Indicates the total number of packets that were never sent after sixteen attempts failed because of collisions.	lateCollisions:  Indicates the number of packets which have had collisions occur in the later part of the packet(after bit 512).	underrun:  Occurs when the microcode cannot put bits into the output silo fast enough to maintain the 10Mbit rate.	stuckOutput:  Indicates the number of times the machine was unable to send a packet in 2.5 seconds.	coll1 to coll16:  Each of these items indicates the number of packets that were sent after the specified number of collisions.%n
