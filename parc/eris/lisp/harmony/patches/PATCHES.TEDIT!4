Harmony Patches===============The following patch files on {ERIS}<Lisp>Harmony>Patches> can be loaded into the released Harmony sysout.ADDDIRFIX	Solves AR 2867: DIR {GENIE}USER:<YONKE>* works but DIR USER:<YONKE>* sends (DIRECTORY "YONKE>USER:<YONKE") [to VAX/VMS running DEI 6.00A], but not "blessed" to go into loadup.COMPPATCH	Solves AR 2979: Compiler doesn't always put ADDREF's and DELREF's under UNINTERRUPTABLY!  Note that this does NOT correct the problem for already-compiled files.DASHINGPATCH	Allows use of dashing within DRAWLINE (submitted by Bobrow.pa)DLAPVARPATCH	Solves AR 2772: Want compiler to discard function arg names; new fn DASSEM.SAVELOCALVARS.  Might want to distribute to people with SERIOUS atom crunch problems.DLIONFSPATCH	Solves AR 2859: Serious DLion File System problems: Truncated files and Null pages; and AR 3136: SYSOUT created without local file system  does not recognize LispFiles volume when installed on another machine.FILLBUFFERPATCH	Fixes a bug in the terminal buffer routines such that if you had the echocontrol for your backspacing character set to REAL instead of IGNORE, the display would get out of wack with the internal buffer.  This only shows up in direct calls to READ to the terminal, not TTYIN calls, which is what most people see.  But ASKUSER, for example, would give funny behavior.  (submitted by Kaplan.pa)FONTNNNPATCH	Solves AR 3025: (FONTUNPARSE '(GACHA 8)) returns (GACHA 8 NNN); causes Tedit files including fontclasses to print wrong.  Also includes patch to \FONTFACE so "bad" Tedit files are read correctly.FPLUSDLispDomino.db	Solves AR 3286: MAPELT2 in FLOATARRAY fails on FPLUS operation on DTiger.  Note that this is not a lisp patch, but a new set of microcode, which has to be installed in a sysout using the function NCLIP in the file SPLICE.DCOM. HARMONYKEYPATCH	Solves various keyboard glitches: "I found and fixed the MARGIN's problem, plus a number of other keyboard glitches, plus a number of extensions for things like TEDITKEY (more shifts, a lock toggle key action)." (submitted by Kaplan.pa)INITDLispDomino.db	Solves AR 3391: New DLion uCode that gives MP 9099 if initial ucode is incompatible.  This is not a lisp patch, but a new set of microcode, which has to be installed in a sysout using the function NCLIP in the file SPLICE.DCOM.  This microcode incorporates all the latest bug fixes which have been put into Intermezzo, and additionally will give a {new} MaintenancePanel Code of 9098 if the initial microcode is incompatible {Intermezzo}.INTERPRESSBITMAPPATCH	Solves AR 2722: IP bitmaps must be multiples of 32 for Services 9.  Patch not incorporated in Harmony sysout because it won't be necessary until mid 85.MENUPATCH	Fixes a bug in slide-off menus in bordered windows (submitted by Kaplan.pa)NSFILEPATCH	Solves AR 3154: COPYFILE to NS file server creates strange subdirectories {NS:}<Drawer>Drawer!3>dir5>filed.  [note: only works for 21-Dec-84 sysout, since it does a \PUTBASE to a specific location (to make a patch in an atom-smashed sysout).PRINT7PATCHPRINT8PATCH	Solves AR 2978: Symbols print bad when printing to Interpress printers with EITHER Services 7 or 8; Character set encoding off.  PRINT7PATCH requires PRINT8PATCH loaded.PRETTYCOM1PATCH	Fixes a bug in the filepkg whereby a filepkg com that had a non-list cdr would get that cdr coerced to NIL, even if the command implementation expected to see the tail.  I don't know when this bug was introduced, but it's most visible effect was that the recommended way of suppressing decl type checks at compile time (the command (IGNOREDECL . T)) failed to work.  (submitted by Kaplan.pa)PROMPTTIMEOUTPATCH	Solves AR 3094: PROMPTFORWORD in Harmony times-out when prompting for Tedit file name; should wait forever.TOPS20FTPPATCH	Solves AR 2860: DIR to TOPS-20 is worse in Harmony than Carol.WHATISPATCH	Fixes a bug in FILES? such that it spelling corrects a new file name to a close old name, without bothering to ask for confirmation.
