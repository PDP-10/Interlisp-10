     INTERLISP-D SUPPORT FOR XEROX 1108 FLOPPY DRIVE     By Kelly Roach.  Last revised: Sept 27, 1983.     Interlisp-D can now be used to read and write files from Pilotformatted floppy disks on Xerox 1108 machines.  (Support for CP/Mfloppies is expected.)  The procedures to use are as follows:     (1) INSERT FLOPPY IN DRIVE.  Place an 8" double sided/doubledensity soft sectored floppy disk into the Xerox 1108 floppy driveand close the drive door     (2) (FLOPPY.FORMAT NAME).  Do (FLOPPY.FORMAT NAME) where NAME maybe an atom or string and will become the name of the floppy.  Thefunction FLOPPY.FORMAT initializes the floppy, erasing any oldinformation on the disk.     (3) FILE DEVICE {FLOPPY}.  Use COPYFILE to copy files onto andoff of your Pilot formatted floppy.  Examples:     (COPYFILE '{PHYLUM}<MYDIR>FILE '{FLOPPY}FILE)     (COPYFILE '{FLOPPY}FILE '{PHYLUM}<MYDIR>FILE)DIR {FLOPPY}* will show you the files that are currently on thefloppy.  All other familiar operations such as LOAD, OPENFILE, READ,PRINT, BIN, BOUT, GETFILEINFO, SETFILEINFO, GETFILEPTR, SETFILEPTR,etc. also work.     (4) REMOVE FLOPPY FROM DRIVE.  Open the drive door to retrievethe floppy.     (5) ALREADY FORMATTED FLOPPIES.  A floppy created by (1)-(4) maybe reinserted into the floppy drive at any time so that files saved onthe floppy may be accessed again.  Just follow (1), (3), and (4),skipping (2).  There are 2276 pages available for the user's files oneach Pilot floppy with the exception that there is 2 pages ofadditional overhead per file stored.
