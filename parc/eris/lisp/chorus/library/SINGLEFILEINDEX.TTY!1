SINGLEFILEINDEXSINGLEFILEINDEX is a package for giving the user an alphabeticalfunction index on the front of any lisp file listed thru lisp.The first page gives the filename and time of creation and thetime of the listing.  Following that (on possibly more than onepage) is N columns of function names and index numbers, where theindex number indicates the function's linear occurence within thefile.  The number of columns is a function of the length of thelongest function name and the number of functions in the file.The the file is printed with the filename, page number, andcurrent function number printed at the top of every page and eachfunction is preceded by it's index number righ-justified on thepage.When SINGLEFILEINDEX is loaded, LISTFILES1 is redefined to listyour files as specified above.  It uses the following variables:FILELINELENGTH to do the right-justification and columnating;PRINTER (default value is LPT:) as the file to open to print theindexed version of the file; and LINESPERPAGE (default value is58) as the number of lines on printer.  These defaults are onlyused if the variables were not bound at the time SINGLEFILEINDEXwas loaded.  Note: the file being indexed does not have to beloaded or even "noticed".This package is similiar to the MULTIFILEINDEX package also inLISPUSERS.  The intent, is that this SINGLEFILEINDEX be simple and fastenough to use anytime you make a file and list it (note thatSINGLEFILEINDEX does not inform you about records, parameters, etc.where MULTIFILEINDEX does).  MULTIFILEINDEX also works across severalfiles and is useful for indexing a whole "system" of files.The function which implements this is:singlefileindex[file;outputFile;newpageflg]	   where FILE is the the lisp source file.  OUTPUTFILE is	   the destination file; if its value is NIL then use the	   globalvar PRINTER (default is LPT:) as the destination	   file.  NEWPAGEFLG if T says to go to a new page before	   printing the index number followed by the function	   definition.  This puts each function definition on its	   own page.  LISTFILES1 calls SINGLEFILEINDEX with	   OUTPUTFILE and NEWPAGEFLG both being NIL.Martin D. Yonke (YONKE@BBND)
