SIMPLEFILEINDEXSIMPLEFILEINDEX  is an "old" version of the <Lisp>Library> package that doesn't have as many features.It gives the user an alphabetical  function index on the front of any lisp file listed thru lisp. The first page gives the filename and time of creation and the time of the listing.  Following that (on possibly more than one page) is N columns of function names and index numbers, where the index number indicates the function's linear occurence within the file.  The number of columns is a function of the length of the longest function name and the number of functions in the file. The the file is printed with the filename, page number, and current function number printed at the top of every page and each function is preceded by it's index number righ-justified on the page.When FILEINDEX is loaded, LISTFILES1 is redefined to list your files as specified above.  It uses the following variables:FILELINELENGTH to do the right-justification and columnatingPRINTER (default value is {LPT}) as the file to open to print the indexed version of the fileLINESPERPAGE (default value is 58) as the number of lines on printer.  These defaults are only used if the variables were not bound at the time SINGLEFILEINDEX was loaded.  Note: the file being indexed does not have to be loaded or even "noticed".<Lisp>Library>SINGLEFILEINDEX has many more features.Larry Masinter (Masinter.PA)
