The top level function is LANDPRESS which takes the same arguments as EMPRESS with an additional optional font specifier in the last position.The font specifier should be a family-size pair, e.g., '(Gacha 12).  LANDPRESS can be run interchangeably with EMPRESS, but not simultaneouslysince it temporarily modifies the defn's of several functions calledby EMPRESS.  The product is the same as EMPRESS, except it is printed sideways on the page allowing for wider output.LANDPRESS has only been tested on the Fugue release.  It may also workon Chorus, but who knows.  Frank
