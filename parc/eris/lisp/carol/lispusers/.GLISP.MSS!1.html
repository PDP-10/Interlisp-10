Novak Jr.Computer Science DepartmentStanford UniversityStanford, California  94305)@BlankSpace(3)@BlankSpace(2)@Center[@B&lt;Revised:&gt; @Value(Date)]@End(TitleBox)@Begin(ResearchCredit)This research was supported in part by NSF grant SED-7912803 in the JointNational Science Foundation - National Institute of Education Programof Research on Cognitive Processes and the Structure of Knowledge inScience and Mathematics, and in part by the Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency under contract MDA-903-80-c-007.@End(ResearchCredit)@End(TitlePage)@Chapter(Introduction)@Section(Overview of GLISP)     GLISP is a LISP-based language which provides high-levellanguage features not found in ordinary LISP.  The GLISP languageis implemented by means of a compiler which accepts GLISP as input andproduces ordinary LISP as output; this output can be further compiledto machine code by the LISP compiler.  GLISP is available for severalLISP dialects, including Interlisp, Maclisp, UCI Lisp, ELISP, FranzLisp, and Portable Standard Lisp.     The goal of GLISP is to allow structured objects to be referencedin a convenient, succinct language, and to allow the structures of objectsto be changed without changing the code which references the objects.GLISP provides both PASCAL-like and English-like syntaxes; much of the powerand brevity of GLISP derive from the compiler features necessary tosupport the relatively informal, English-like language constructs.The following example function illustrates how GLISP permits definitereference to structured objects.@Begin(ProgramExample)(HourlySalaries (GLAMBDA ( (a DEPARTMENT) )   (for each EMPLOYEE who is HOURLY      (PRIN1 NAME) (SPACES 3) (PRINT SALARY) )  ))@End(ProgramExample)The features provided by GLISP include the following:@Begin(Enumerate)GLISP maintains knowledge of the "context" of the computation as theprogram is executed.  Features of objects which are in context may bereferenced directly; the compiler will determine how to reference theobjects given the current context, and will add the newly referencedobjects to the context.  In the above example, the function'sargument, an object whose class isDEPARTMENT, establishes an initial context relative towhich EMPLOYEEs can be found.  In the context of an EMPLOYEE, NAMEand SALARY can be found.GLISP supports flexible object definition and reference with apowerful abstract datatype facility.Object classes are easily declared to the system.  An objectdeclaration includes a definition of the storage structure of theobject and declarations of properties of the object; these may bedeclared in such a way that they compile open, resulting in efficientobject code.  GLISP supports object-centered programming, in whichprocesses are invoked by means of "messages" sent to objects.Object structures may be LISP structures (for which code isautomatically compiled) or Units in the user's favorite representationlanguage (for which the user can supply compilation functions).Loop constructs, such as@ (FOR EACH &lt;item&gt; WITH &lt;property&gt; DO ...)@ ,are compiled into loops of the appropriate form.Compilation of infix expressions is provided for the arithmeticoperators and for additional operators which facilitate list manipulation.Operators are interpreted appropriately for Lisp datatypes as well asfor numbers; operator overloading for user-defined objects is providedusing the message facility.The GLISP compiler infers the types of objects when possible, and usesthis knowledge to generate efficient object code.  By performing@I[ compilation relative to a knowledge base ], GLISP is able to performcertain computations (e.g., inheritance of an attached procedurefrom a parent class of an objectin a knowledge base) at compile time rather than at runtime, resultingin much faster execution.By separating object definitions from the code which references objects,GLISP permits radical changes to object structures with no changes tocode.@End(Enumerate)@Section(Implementation)     GLISP is implemented by means of a compiler, which produces anormal Lisp EXPR from the GLISP code; the GLISP code is saved on thefunction's property list, and the compiled definition replaces theGLISP definition.  Use of GLISP entails the cost of a singlecompilation, but otherwise is about as efficient as normal LISP.The LISP code produced by GLISP can be further compiled to machinecode by the LISP compiler.GLISP functionsare indicated by the use of GLAMBDA instead of LAMBDA in the functiondefinition.  When the Lisp interpreter sees the GLAMBDA, itcalls the GLISP compilerto incrementally compile the GLISP function.The compiled version replaces the GLISP version (which is saved on thefunction name's property list), and is used thereafter.This automatic compilation feature is currently implemented in Interlispand in Franz Lisp.  In other dialects, it is necessary for the user toexplicitly invoke compilation of GLISP functions by calling the compilerfunction @PE[GLCC] for each one.     To use GLISP, it is first necessary to load the compiler file intoLisp.  Users' files containing structure descriptions and GLISP codeare then loaded.  Compilation of a GLISP function is requested by:@Tabset(1.7 inch)@Begin(Format)@PE[(GLCC 'FN)]@\Compile @PE[FN].@PE[(GLCP 'FN)]@\Compile @PE[FN] and prettyprint the result.@PE[(GLP 'FN)]@\Print the compiled version of @PE[FN].@End(Format)In Interlisp, all the GLISP functions (beginning with GLAMBDA) in a filecan be compiled by invoking @PE[(GLCOMPCOMS@ &lt;file&gt;COMS)], where@PE[&lt;file&gt;COMS] is the list of file package commands for the file.Properties of compiled functions are stored on the property list ofthe function name:@Begin(Format)@PE[GLORIGINALEXPR]@\Original (GLISP) version of the function.@FOOT[Theoriginal definition is saved as EXPR in Interlisp.]@PE[GLCOMPILED]@\GLISP-compiled version of the function.@PE[GLRESULTTYPE]@\Type of the result of the function.@PE[GLARGUMENTTYPES]@\Types of the arguments of the function.@End(format)Properties of GLISP functions can be examined with the function@PE[(GLED '&lt;name&gt;)], which calls the Lisp editor on the propertylist of @PE[&lt;name&gt;].  @PE[(GLEDF '&lt;name&gt;)] calls the Lisp editor on theoriginal (GLISP) definition of @PE[&lt;name&gt;].@Section(Error Messages)GLISP provides detailed error messages when compilation errors aredetected; many careless errors such as misspellings will be caughtby the compiler.  When the source program contains errors, thecompiled code generates runtime errors upon execution of theerroneous expressions.@Section(Interactive Features of GLISP)Several features of GLISP are available interactively, as well as incompiled functions:@Enumerate{The @PE[A] function, which creates structured objects from a readableproperty/value list, is available as an interactive function.Messages to objects can be executed interactively.A display editor/inspector, GEV, is available for use with bitmapgraphics terminals.@Foot[GEV is currently implemented only for XeroxLisp machines.]  GEV interprets objects according to their GLISPstructure descriptions; it allows the user to inspect objects, editthem, interactively construct programs which operate on them, displaycomputed properties, send messages to objects, and "push down" toinspect data values.}@Chapter(Object Descriptions)@Section(Declaration of Object Descriptions)An @I(Object Description) in GLISP is a description of the structureof an object in terms of named substructures, together with definitionsof ways of referencing the object.  The latter may include@I( properties )(i.e., data whose values are not stored, but are computedfrom the values of stored data), adjectival predicates, and@I(messages) which the object can receive; the messages can be used toimplement operator overloading and other compilation features.Object Descriptions are obtained by GLISP in several ways:@Begin(Enumerate)The descriptions of basic datatypes (e.g., INTEGER) are automaticallyknown to the compiler.Structure descriptions (but not full object descriptions) may be useddirectly as @I(types) in function definitions.The user may declare object descriptions to the system using thefunction GLISPOBJECTS; the names of the object types may then beused as @I[ types ] in function definitions and definitions of otherstructures.Object descriptions may be included as part of a knowledgerepresentation language, and are then furnished to GLISP by theinterface package written for that representation language.@End(Enumerate)LISP data structures are declared using the function GLISPOBJECTS@Foot{Once declared, object descriptions may be included in INTERLISP programfiles by including in the &lt;file&gt;COMS a statement of the form:@PE[(GLISPOBJECTS@ &lt;object-name@-(1)&gt;@ ...@ &lt;object-name@-(n)&gt;)]},which takes one or more objectdescriptions as arguments (assuming the descriptions to be quoted).Since GLISP compilation is performed relative to the knowledge baseof object descriptions, the object descriptions must be declaredprior to GLISP compilation of functions using those descriptions.The format of each description is as follows:@Begin(ProgramExample)(&lt;object name&gt;   &lt;structure description&gt;          PROP   &lt;property descriptions&gt;          ADJ    &lt;adjective descriptions&gt;          ISA    &lt;predicate descriptions&gt;          MSG    &lt;message descriptions&gt;          SUPERS &lt;list of superclasses&gt;          VALUES &lt;list of values&gt;              )@End(ProgramExample)The &lt;object name&gt; and &lt;structure description&gt; are required; the otherproperty/value pairs are optional, and may appear in any order.The following example illustrates some of thedeclarations which might be made to describe the object type@PE(VECTOR).@Begin(ProgramExample)(GLISPOBJECTS   (VECTOR   (CONS (X NUMBER) (Y NUMBER))      PROP   ( (MAGNITUDE  ((SQRT X*X + Y*Y))) )      ADJ    ( (ZERO       (X IS ZERO AND Y IS ZERO))               (NORMALIZED (MAGNITUDE = 1.0)) )      MSG    ( (+          VECTORPLUS OPEN T)               (-          VECTORDIFFERENCE) )     ))@End(ProgramExample)@Subsection(Property Descriptions)Each @PE[&lt;description&gt;] specified with PROP, ADJ, ISA, or MSGhas the following format:@Begin(ProgramExample)(&lt;name&gt;  &lt;response&gt;  &lt;prop@-[1]&gt; &lt;value@-[1]&gt; ... &lt;prop@-[n]&gt; &lt;value@-[n]&gt;)@END(ProgramExample)where @PE[&lt;name&gt;] is the (atomic) name of the property, @PE[&lt;response&gt;]is a function name or a list of GLISP code to be compiled in placeof the property, and the @PE[&lt;prop&gt;@ &lt;value&gt;] pairs are optionalproperties which affect compilation.  All four kinds ofproperties are compiled in a similar fashion, asdescribed in the section "Compilation of Messages".@Subsection(Supers Description)The SUPERS list specifies a list of @I[ superclasses ], i.e., the namesof other object descriptions from which the object may inherit PROP,ADJ, ISA, and MSG properties.  Inheritance from superclasses can berecursive, as described under "Compilation of Messages".@Subsection(Values Description)The VALUES list is a list of pairs, @PE[ (&lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;) ], which isused to associate symbolic names with constant values for an objecttype.  If VALUES are defined for the type of the @I[ selector ] of aCASE statement, the corresponding symbolic names may be used as theselection values for the clauses of the CASE statement.@Section(Structure Descriptions)     Much of the power of GLISP is derived from its use of StructureDescriptions.  A Structure Description (abbreviated "&lt;sd&gt;") is a meansof describing a LISP data structure and giving names to parts of thestructure; it is similar in concept to a Record declaration in PASCAL.Structure descriptions are used by the GLISP compiler to generate codeto retrieve and store parts of structures.@Subsection(Syntax of Structure Descriptions)     The syntax of structuredescriptions is recursively defined in terms of basic types andcomposite types which are built up from basic types.  The syntax ofstructure descriptions is as follows:@Foot[The names of the basic types and the structuring operators mustbe all upper-case or lower-case, depending on the case which is usual forthe underlying Lisp system.  In general, other GLISP keywords anduser program names may be in upper-case, lower-case, or mixed-case,if mixed cases are permitted by the Lisp system.]@Begin(Enumerate)The following basic types are known to the compiler:@Begin(Format)@Tabdivide(3)@B(ATOM)@B(INTEGER)@B(REAL)@B(NUMBER)@\(either INTEGER or REAL)@B(STRING)@B(BOOLEAN)@\(either T or NIL)@B(ANYTHING)@\(an arbitrary structure)@End(Format)An object type which is known to the compiler, either from a GLISPOBJECTSdeclaration or because it is a Class of units in the user's knowledgerepresentation language, is a valid type for use in a structuredescription.  The &lt;name&gt;@  of such an object type may be specifieddirectly as &lt;name&gt; or, for readability, as @ @B[(A]@ &lt;name&gt;@B[)]@ or @ @B[(AN]@ &lt;name&gt;@B[)].@Foot[Whenever the form @B&lt;(A ...)&gt; is allowed in GLISP, the form@B&lt;(AN ...)&gt; is also allowed.]@ Any substructure can be named by enclosing itin a list prefixed by the name: @ @B[(]&lt;name&gt;@ @ &lt;sd&gt;@B[)]@ .This allows the same substructure to have multiple names."A", "AN", and the names used in forming composite types (given below)are treated as reserved words, and may not be used as names.Composite Structures:@  Structured data types composed of other structures are described usingthe following structuring operators:@Begin(Enumerate)(@B[CONS]@ @ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;@ @ &lt;sd@-[2]&gt;)@*The CONS of two structures whose descriptionsare &lt;sd@-[1]&gt; and &lt;sd@-[2]&gt;.(@B[LIST]@ @ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;@ @ &lt;sd@-[2]&gt;@ @ ...@ @ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;)@*A list of exactly the elementswhose descriptions are &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[2]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;.(@B[LISTOF]@ @ &lt;sd&gt;)@*A list of zero or more elements, each of which hasthe description &lt;sd&gt;.(@B[ALIST]@ @ (&lt;name@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;)@ ...@ (&lt;name@-[n]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;))@*An association listin which the atom &lt;name@-[i]&gt;, if present, is associated with a structurewhose description is &lt;sd@-[i]&gt;.(@B[PROPLIST]@ @ (&lt;name@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;)@ ...@ (&lt;name@-[n]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;))@*An association list in "property-list format" (alternating names andvalues)in which the atom &lt;name@-[i]&gt;, if present, is associated with a structurewhose description is &lt;sd@-[i]&gt;.(@B[ATOM]@ @ @ (@B[BINDING]@ @ &lt;sd&gt;)@ @ @ @ (@B[PROPLIST]@ @ (&lt;pname@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;)@ ...@ @~(&lt;pname@-[n]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;)@ ))@*This describes an atom with its binding and/or its property list;either the BINDING or the PROPLIST group may be omitted.Each property name &lt;pname@-[i]&gt; is treated as a property list indicatoras well as the name of the substructure.  When creation of such astructure is specified, GLISP will compile code to create a GENSYM atom.(@B[RECORD]@ @ &lt;recordname&gt;@ @ (&lt;name@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;)@ @ ...@ @ (&lt;name@-[n]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;))@*RECORD specifies the use of contiguous records for data storage.&lt;recordname&gt; is the name of the record type; it is optional,and is not used in some Lisp dialects.@Foot[RECORDs areimplemented using RECORDs in Interlisp, HUNKs in Maclisp and Franz Lisp,VECTORs in Portable Standard Lisp, and lists in UCI Lisp and ELISP.In Interlisp, appropriate RECORD declarations must be made to the systemby the user in addition to the GLISP declarations.](@B[TRANSPARENT]@ @ &lt;type&gt;)@*An object of type &lt;type&gt; is incorporated into the structure beingdefined in @I[transparent mode], which means that all fields andproperties of the object of type &lt;type&gt; can be directly referencedas if they were properties of the object being defined.  A substructurewhich is a named @I[ type ] and which is not declared to be TRANSPARENTis assumed to be opaque, i.e., its internal structure cannot be seenunless an access path explicitly names the subrecord.@Foot{For example,a PROFESSOR record might contain some fields which are unique toprofessors, plus a pointer to an EMPLOYEE record.  If the declarationin the PROFESSOR record were @PE[(EMPREC@ (TRANSPARENT@ EMPLOYEE))],then a field of the employee record, say SALARY, could be referenceddirectly from a variable P which points to a PROFESSOR record as@PE[ P:SALARY ]; if the declaration were @PE[(EMPREC@ EMPLOYEE)],it would be necessary to say @PE[P:EMPREC:SALARY].}The objectof type &lt;type&gt; may also contain TRANSPARENT objects; the graph ofTRANSPARENT object references must of course be acyclic.(@B[OBJECT]@ @ (&lt;name@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;)@ ...@ (&lt;name@-[n]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;))@*(@B[ATOMOBJECT]@ @ (&lt;name@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;)@ ...@ (&lt;name@-[n]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;))@*(@B[LISTOBJECT]@ @ (&lt;name@-[1]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[1]&gt;)@ ...@ (&lt;name@-[n]&gt;@ &lt;sd@-[n]&gt;))@*These declarations describe @I[ Objects ], data structures which canreceive messages at runtime.  The three types of objects are implementedas records, atoms, or lists, respectively.  In each case, the systemadds to the objecta @PE[CLASS] datum which points to the name of the type of theobject.  An object declaration may only appear as the top-leveldeclaration of a named object type.@End(Enumerate)@End(Enumerate)@Subsection(Examples of Structure Descriptions)     The following examples illustrate the use of Structure Descriptions.@Begin(ProgramExample)(GLISPOBJECTS    (CAT (LIST (NAME ATOM)               (PROPERTIES (LIST (CONS (SEX ATOM)                                       (WEIGHT INTEGER))                                 (AGE INTEGER)                                 (COLOR ATOM)))               (LIKESCATNIP BOOLEAN)))    (PERSON (ATOM              (PROPLIST                (CHILDREN (LISTOF (A PERSON)))                (AGE INTEGER)                (PETS (LIST (CATS (LISTOF CAT))                            (DOGS (LISTOF (A DOG))) ))             )))   )@End(ProgramExample)     The first structure, CAT, is entirely composed of list structure.An CAT structure might look like:@Begin(ProgramExample)(PUFF ((MALE . 10) 5 CALICO) T)@End(ProgramExample)Given a CAT object X, we could ask for its WEIGHT [equivalent to(CDAADR X)] or for a subrecord such as PROPERTIES [equivalentto (CADR X)].  Having set a variable Y to the PROPERTIES,we could also ask for the WEIGHT from Y [equivalent to (CDAR Y)].In general, whenever a subrecord is accessed, the structure descriptionof the subrecord is associated with it by the compiler,enabling further accesses to parts of thesubrecord.  Thus, the meaningof a subrecord name depends on the type of record from which thesubrecord is retrieved.  The subrecord AGE has two differentmeanings when applied to PERSONs and CATs.     The second structure, PERSON, illustrates a description ofan object which is a Lisp atom with properties stored on its propertylist.  Whereas no structure names appear in an actual CAT structure,the substructures of a PROPLIST operator must be named, andthe names appear in the actual structures.  For example, if X is aPERSON structure, retrieval of the AGE of X is equivalent to@PE[(GETPROP@ X@ 'AGE)].A subrecord of a PROPLIST record can be referenced directly; e.g., onecan ask for the DOGS of a PERSON directly, without cognizance ofthe fact that DOGS is part of the PETS property.@Section(Editing of Object Descriptions)An object description can be edited by calling @PE[ (GLEDS TYPE) ],where @PE[ TYPE ] is the name of the object type.  This will cause theLisp editor to be called on the object description of @PE[ TYPE ].@Section(Interactive Editing of Objects)An interactive structure inspector/editor, GEV, is available for theXerox 1100-series lisp machines.  GEV allows the user to inspect andedit any structures which are described by GLISP object descriptions,to "zoom in" on substructures of interest, and to display the valuesof computed properties automatically or on demand.  GEV is describedin a separate document.@Section(Global Variables)The types of free variables can be declared within the functions whichreference them.  Alternatively, the types of global variables can bedeclared to the compiler using theform:@Foot[@PE{(GLISPGLOBALS@ &lt;name@-(1)&gt;@ ...@ &lt;name@-(n)&gt;)}is defined as a file package command for Interlisp.]@Begin(ProgramExample)(GLISPGLOBALS  (&lt;name&gt; &lt;type&gt;) ... )@End(ProgramExample)Following such a declaration, the compiler will assume a free variable&lt;name&gt; is of the corresponding &lt;type&gt;.  A GLOBAL object does not haveto actually exist as a storage structure; for example, one could definea global object "MOUSE" or "SYSTEM" whose properties are actuallyimplemented by calls to the operating system.@Section(Compile-Time Constants and Conditional Compilation)The values and types of compile-time constants can be declared to thecompiler using theform:@Foot[@PE{(GLISPCONSTANTS@ &lt;name@-(1)&gt;@ ...@ &lt;name@-(n)&gt;)}is defined as a file package command for Interlisp.]@Programexample[(GLISPCONSTANTS  (&lt;name&gt; &lt;value-expression&gt; &lt;type&gt;) ... )]The &lt;name&gt; and &lt;type&gt; fields are assumed to be quoted.  The@PE[ &lt;value-expression&gt; ] field is a GLISP expression which isparsed and evaluated; this allows constants to be defined by expressionsinvolving previously defined constants.The GLISP compiler will perform many kinds of computations onconstants at compile time, reducing the size of the compiled code andimproving execution speed.@Foot[Ordinary Lisp functions are evaluatedon constant arguments if the property @PE(GLEVALWHENCONST) is set to T onthe property list of the function name.  This property is set by thecompiler for the basic arithmetic functions.]In particular, arithmetic, comparison,logical, conditional, and CASE function calls are optimized, withelimination of dead code.  This permits conditional compilation ina clean form.  Code can be written which tests the values of flagsin the usual way; if the flag values are then declared to becompile-time constants using GLISPCONSTANTS,the tests will be performed at compile time, and the unneeded codewill vanish.@Chapter(Reference To Objects)@Section(Accessing Objects)The problem of reference is the problem of determining what object,or feature of a structured object, is referred to by some part ofa statement in a language.  Most programming languages solve theproblem of reference by unique naming: each distinct object in aprogram unit has a unique name, and is referenced by that name.Reference to a part of a structured object is done by giving the nameof the variable denoting that object and a path specification whichtells how to get to the desired part from the whole.GLISP permits reference by unique naming and path specification,but in addition permits @I[definite reference relative to context.]A @I[definite reference] is a reference to an object which has notbeen explicitly named before, but which can be understood relativeto the current context of computation.  If, for example, an objectof type VECTOR (as defined earlier) is in context, the programstatement@Begin(ProgramExample)(IF X IS NEGATIVE ...@End(ProgramExample)contains a definite reference to "X", which may be interpreted as theX substructure of the VECTOR which is in context.  The definition ofthe computational context and the way in which definite referencesare resolved are covered in a later section of this manual.In the following section, which describes the syntaxes of referenceto objects in GLISP, the following notation is used.  "&lt;var&gt;" refersto a variable name in the usual LISP sense, i.e., a LAMBDA variable,PROG variable, or GLOBAL variable; the variable is assumed to pointto (be bound to) an object.  "&lt;type&gt;" refers to the type of objectpointed to by a variable.  "&lt;property&gt;" refers to a property or subrecord ofan object.     Two syntaxes are available for reference to objects: anEnglish-like syntax, and a PASCAL-like syntax.The two are equivalent, and may be intermixed freely within a GLISPfunction.  The allowable forms of references in the two syntaxes areshown in the table below.@Begin(Format)@TabDivide(3)@U("PASCAL" Syntax)@\@U("English" Syntax)@\@U(Meaning)&lt;var&gt;@\&lt;var&gt;@\The object denoted@\@\by &lt;var&gt;@B[:]&lt;type&gt;@\@B[The] &lt;type&gt;@\The object whose type@\@\is &lt;type&gt;@B[:]&lt;property&gt;@\@B[The] &lt;property&gt;@\The &lt;property&gt; of@I[or] &lt;property&gt;@\@\some object&lt;var&gt;@B[:]&lt;property&gt;@\@B[The] &lt;property&gt; @B[of] &lt;var&gt;@\The &lt;property&gt; of the@\@\object denoted by &lt;var&gt;@End(Format)These forms can be extended to specify longer paths in the obvious way,as in "The AGE of the SPOUSE of the HEAD of the DEPARTMENT" or"DEPARTMENT:HEAD:SPOUSE:AGE".  Note that there is no distinctionbetween reference to substructures and reference to properties asfar as the syntax of the referencing code is concerned; thisfacilitates hiding the internal structures of objects.@Section(Creation of Objects)GLISP allows the creation of structures to be specified by expressionsof the form:@BlankSpace(1)@B[(A] &lt;type&gt; @P[with] &lt;property@-[1]&gt; @P[=] &lt;value@-[1]&gt; @P[,] ... @P[,] @~&lt;property@-[n]&gt; @P[=] &lt;value@-[n]&gt;@B[)]@BlankSpace(1)In this expression, the "@I[with]", "=", and "," are allowed forreadability, but may be omitted if desired@Foot[Some Lisp dialects,e.g. Maclisp, will interpret commas as "backquote" commands and generateerror messages.  In such dialects, the commas must be omitted or be"slashified".]; if present, they must allbe delimited on both sides by blanks.In response to such an expression, GLISP will generate code to createa new instance ofthe specified structure.  The &lt;property&gt; names may be specified in anyorder.  Unspecified properties are defaulted according to thefollowing rules:@Begin(Enumerate)Basic types are defaulted to 0 for INTEGER and NUMBER, 0.0 for REAL,and NIL for other types.Composite structures are created from the defaults of theircomponents, except that missing PROPLIST and ALIST items whichwould default to NIL are omitted.@End(Enumerate)Except for missing PROPLIST and ALIST elements, as noted above, anewly created LISP structure will contain all of the fields specifiedin its structure description.@Section(Interpretive Creation of Objects)The "A" function is defined for interpretive use as well as for usewithin GLISP functions.@Section(Predicates on Objects)Adjectives defined for structures using the @PE[ADJ] and @PE[ISA]specifications may be used in predicate expressions on objects in@B[If] and @B[For] statements.  The syntax of basic predicateexpressions is:@Begin(ProgramExample)&lt;object&gt; @b[is] &lt;adjective&gt;&lt;object&gt; @B[is a] &lt;isa-adjective&gt;@End(ProgramExample)Basic predicate expressions may be combined using AND, OR, NOT or ~, andgrouping parentheses.The compiler automatically recognizes the LISP adjectivesATOMIC, NULL, NIL, INTEGER,REAL, ZERO, NUMERIC, NEGATIVE, MINUS, and BOUND, and the ISA-adjectivesATOM, LIST, NUMBER, INTEGER, SYMBOL, STRING, ARRAY, andBIGNUM@Foot[where applicable.]; user definitions have precedenceover these pre-defined adjectives.@Subsection(Self-Recognition Adjectives)If the ISA-adjective @PE[ self ] is defined for an object type, thetype name may be used as an ISA-adjective to test whether a givenobject is a member of that type.  Given a predicate phrase of theform "@PE[@ X@ is@ a@ Y@ ]", the compiler first looks at the definitionof the object type of @PE[ X ] to see if @PE[ Y ] is defined as anISA-adjective for such objects.If no such ISA-adjective is found, and @PE[ Y ]is a type name, the compiler looks to see if @PE[ self ]is defined as an ISA-adjective for @PE[ Y ], and if so, compiles it.If a @PE[ self ] ISA-adjective predicate is compiled as the test of an@B[If], @B[While], or @B[For] statement, and the tested object is asimple variable, the variable will be known to be of that type withinthe scope of the test.  For example, in the statement@Begin(ProgramExample)   (If X is a FOO then (&larr; X Print) ...@End(ProgramExample)the compiler will know that X is a FOO if the test succeeds, and willcompile the Print message appropriate for a FOO, even if the type ofX was declared as something other than FOO earlier.  This feature isuseful in implementing disjunctive types, as discussed in a latersection.@Subsection(Testing Object Classes)For those data types which are defined using one of the OBJECTstructuring operators, the Class name is automatically defined as anISA-adjective.  The ISA test is implemented by runtime examination ofthe CLASS datum of the object.@Chapter(GLISP Program Syntax)@Section(Function Syntax)     GLISP function syntax is essentially the same as that of LISPwith the addition of type information and RESULT and GLOBAL declarations.The basic function syntax is:@Foot[The PROG is not required.  In Lisp dialects other than Interlisp,LAMBDA may be used instead of GLAMBDA.]@Begin(ProgramExample)(&lt;function-name&gt; (@B[GLAMBDA] (&lt;arguments&gt;)                         @P[(RESULT] &lt;result-description&gt;@P[)]                         @P[(GLOBAL] &lt;global-variable-descriptions&gt;@P[)]      (PROG (&lt;prog-variables&gt;)            &lt;code&gt;   )))@End(ProgramExample)     The RESULT declaration is optional; in many cases, the compilerwill infer the result type automatically.  The main use of the RESULTdeclaration is to allow the compiler to determine the result typewithout compiling the function, which may be useful when compilinganother function which calls it.  The &lt;result-description&gt; is astandard structure description or &lt;type&gt;.     The GLOBAL declaration is used to inform the compiler of thetypes of free variables.  The function GLISPGLOBALS can be used todeclare the types of global variables, making GLOBAL declarationswithin individual functions unnecessary.     The major difference between a GLISP function definition and astandard LISP definition is the presence of type declarations forvariables, which are in PASCAL-like syntax of the following forms:@Begin(ProgramExample)&lt;variable&gt;@B[:]&lt;type&gt;&lt;variable&gt;@B[:(A] &lt;type&gt;@B[)]&lt;variable&gt;@B[,]&lt;variable&gt;@B[,]...@B[:]&lt;type&gt;&lt;variable&gt;@B[,]&lt;variable&gt;@B[,]...@B[:(A] &lt;type&gt;@B[)]          @B[:]&lt;type&gt;           @B[(A] &lt;type&gt;@B[)]@End(ProgramExample)In addition to declared &lt;type&gt;s, a Structure Description may beused directly as a &lt;type&gt; in a variable declaration.Type declarations are required only for variables whose subrecords orproperties will be referenced.  In general, if the value of a variable iscomputed in such a way that the type of the value can be inferred, thevariable will receive the appropriate type automatically; in suchcases, no type declaration is necessary.  Since GLISP maintains a@I[context] of the computation, it is often unnecessary to name avariable which is an argument of a function;in such cases, it is only necessary to specify the &lt;type&gt; ofthe argument, as shown in the latter two syntax forms above.PROG and GLOBAL declarations must always specify variablenames (with optional types); the ability to directly reference featuresof objects reduces the number of PROG variables needed in many cases.Initial values for PROG variables may be specified, as in Interlisp,by enclosing the variable and its initial value in a list@Foot[Thisfeature is available in all Lisp dialects.]:@ProgramExample{(PROG (X (N 0) Y) ...)}However, the syntax of variable declarations does not permit the typeof a variable and its initial value to both be specified.@Section(Expressions)GLISP provides translation of infix expressions of the kind usuallyfound in programming languages.  In addition, it provides additionaloperators which facilitate list manipulation and other operations.Overloading of operators for user-defined types is provided by meansof the @I[message] facility.Expressions may be written directly in-line within function references,as in@PE[ (SQRT X*X + Y*Y) ],or they may be written within parentheses; parentheses may be used forgrouping in the usual way.  Operators may be written with or withoutdelimiting spaces, @I[except for the "-" operator, which @P(must) be delimitedby spaces].@Foot[The "-" operator is required to be delimited by spaces since "-" isoften used as a hyphen within variable names.  The "-" operator will berecognized within "atom" names if the flag GLSEPMINUS is set to T.]Expression parsing is done by an operator precedence parser, using thesame precedence ordering as in FORTRAN.@Foot[The precedence of compound operators is higher than assignmentbut lower than that of all other operators.  The operators@PE[&uarr; &larr; &larr;+ +&larr; &larr;- -&larr;] are right-associative; all others are left-associative.]The operators which are recognized are as follows:@Foot&lt;In Maclisp, theoperator @PE[/] must be written @PE[//].&gt;@Begin(Format)@TabDivide(3)Assignment@\@PE(&larr;) @I[ or ] @PE[:=]Arithmetic@\@PE[+  -  *  /  &uarr;]Comparison@\@PE[=  @R&lt;~&gt;= &lt;&gt; &lt;  &lt;=  &gt;  &gt;=]Logical@\@PE[AND  OR  NOT  @R&lt;~&gt;]Compound@\@PE(&larr;+  &larr;-  +&larr;  -&larr;)@End(Format)@Subsection(Interpretation of Operators)In addition to the usual interpretation of operators when used withnumeric arguments, some of the operators are interpreted appropriatelyfor other Lisp types.@Paragraph(Operations on Strings)For operands of type STRING, the operator @PE[ + ] performsconcatenation.  All of the comparison operators are defined for STRINGs.@Paragraph(Operations on Lists)Several operators are defined in such a way that they perform setoperations on lists of the form @PE[ (LISTOF@ &lt;type&gt;) ], where@PE[ &lt;type&gt; ] is considered to be the element type.  The followingtable shows the interpretations of the operators:@Begin(Format)@Tabdivide(3)@PE[&lt;list&gt; + &lt;list&gt;]@\Set Union@PE[&lt;list&gt; - &lt;list&gt;]@\Set Difference@PE[&lt;list&gt; * &lt;list&gt;]@\Set Intersection@PE[&lt;list&gt;     +   &lt;element&gt;]@\CONS@PE[&lt;element&gt;  +   &lt;list&gt;]@\CONS@PE[&lt;list&gt;     -   &lt;element&gt;]@\REMOVE@PE[&lt;element&gt;  &lt;=  &lt;list&gt;]@\MEMBER or MEMB@PE[&lt;list&gt;     &gt;=  &lt;element&gt;]@\MEMBER or MEMB@End(Format)@Paragraph(Compound Operators)Each compound operator performs an operation involving the argumentsof the operator and assigns a value to the left-hand argument;compound operators are therefore thought of as "destructive change"operators.The meaning of a compound operator depends on the type of itsleft-hand argument, as shown in the following table:@Begin(Group)@Begin(Format)@TabDivide(5)@U(Operator)@\@U(Mnemonic)@\@U(NUMBER)@\@U(LISTOF)@\@U(BOOLEAN)@B[@PE(&larr;+)]@\@I(Accumulate)@\PLUS@\NCONC1@\OR@B[@PE(&larr;-)]@\@I(Remove)@\DIFFERENCE@\REMOVE@\AND NOT@B[@PE(+&larr;)]@\@I(Push)@\PLUS@\PUSH@\OR@B[@PE(-&larr;)]@\@I(Pop)@\@\POP@Foot[For the Pop operator, the arguments are inthe reverse of the usual order, i.e., (TOP@ @PE(-&larr;)@ STACK) will pop thetop element off STACK and assign the element removed to TOP.]@End(Format)@End(Group)As an aid in remembering the list operators, the arrow may bethought of as representing the list, with the head of the arrow beingthe front of the list and the operation (+ or -) appearing where theoperation occurs on the list.  Thus, for example, @PE(&larr;+) adds an elementat the end of the list, while @PE(+&larr;) adds an element at the front of thelist.Each of the compound operators performs an assignment to its left-handside; the above table shows an abbreviation of the operation which isperformed prior to the assignment.The following examples show the effects of the operator "@PE(&larr;+)" onlocal variables of different types:@Begin(Format)@TabDivide(3)@U(Type)@\@U(Source Code)@\@U(Compiled Code)INTEGER@\@PE(I &larr;+ 5)@\@PE[(SETQ I (IPLUS I 5))]BOOLEAN@\@PE(P &larr;+ Q)@\@PE[(SETQ P (OR P Q))]LISTOF@\@PE(L &larr;+ ITEM)@\@PE[(SETQ L (NCONC1 L ITEM))]@END(Format)When the compound operators are not specifically defined for a type,they are interpreted as specifying the operation (@PE[+] or @PE[-])on the two operands, followed by assignment of the result to theleft-hand operand.@Paragraph(Assignment)Assignment of a value to the left-hand argument of an assignmentoperator is relatively flexible in GLISP.  The following kinds ofoperands are allowed on the left-hand side of an assignment operator:@Begin(Enumerate)Variables.Stored substructures of a structured type.PROPerties of a structured type, whenever the interpretation of the PROPertywould be a legal left-hand side.Algebraic expressions involving numeric types, @I[ provided ] thatthe expression ultimately involves only one occurrence of a variableor stored value.@Foot{For example, @PE[(X&uarr;2 &larr; 2.0)] is acceptable,but @PE[(X*X@ &larr;@ 2.0)] is not because the variable @PE[X] occurs twice.}@End(Enumerate)For example, consider the following Object Description for a CIRCLE:@ProgramExample{(CIRCLE (LIST (START VECTOR) (RADIUS REAL))  PROP  ((PI            (3.1415926))         (DIAMETER      (RADIUS*2))         (CIRCUMFERENCE (PI*DIAMETER))         (AREA          (PI*RADIUS&uarr;2))) )}Given this description, and a CIRCLE @PE[ C ],the following are legal assignments:@Programexample{(C:RADIUS &larr; 5.0)(C:AREA &larr; 100.0)(C:AREA &larr; C:AREA*2)(C:AREA &larr;+ 100.0)}@Paragraph(Self-Assignment Operators@Foot[This section may be skipped by the casual user of GLISP.])There are some cases where it would be desirable to let an objectperform an assignment of its own value.  For example, the user mightwant to define @I[PropertyList] as an abstract datatype, with messagessuch as GETPROP and PUTPROP, and use PropertyLists as substructuresof other datatypes.  However, a message such as PUTPROP may cause thePropertyList object to modify its own structure, perhaps even changingits structure from NIL to a non-NIL value.  If the function whichimplements PUTPROP performs a normal assignment to its "self" variable,the assignment will affect only the local variable, and will not modifythe PropertyList component of the containing structure.  The purposeof the Self-Assignment Operators is to allow such modification of thevalue within the containing structure.The Self-Assignment Operators are @PE[&larr;&larr;], @PE[&larr;&larr;+], @PE[&larr;+&larr;], and@PE[&larr;&larr;-], corresponding to the operators @PE[&larr;], @PE[&larr;+], @PE[+&larr;],and @PE[&larr;-], respectively.  The meaning of these operators is thatthe assignment is performed to the object on the left-hand side ofthe operator, @I[as seen from the structure containing the object].The use of these operators is highly restricted; any use of aSelf-Assignment Operator must meet all of the following conditions:@Begin(Enumerate)A Self-Assignment Operator can only be used within a Message functionwhich is compiled OPEN.The left-hand side of the assignment must be a simple variable whichis an argument of the function.The left-hand-side variable must be given a unique (unusual) name toprevent accidental aliasing with a user variable name.@End(Enumerate)As an example, the PUTPROP message for a PropertyList datatype couldbe implemented as follows:@Begin(ProgramExample) (PropertyList.PUTPROP (GLAMBDA (PropertyListPUTPROPself prop val)      (PropertyListPUTPROPself &larr;&larr;                (LISTPUT PropertyListPUTPROPself prop val)) ))@End(ProgramExample)@Section(Control Statements)GLISP provides several PASCAL-like control statements.@Subsection(IF Statement)The syntax of the IF statement is as follows:@Begin(ProgramExample)(@B[IF]         &lt;condition@-[1]&gt; @P[THEN] &lt;action@-[11]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[1i]&gt;    @P[ELSEIF] &lt;condition@-[2]&gt; @P[THEN] &lt;action@-[21]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[2j]&gt;    ...    @P[ELSE]   &lt;action@-[m1]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[mk]&gt;)@End(ProgramExample)Such a statement is translated to a COND of the obvious form.  The"THEN" keyword is optional, as are the "ELSEIF" and "ELSE" clauses.@Subsection(CASE Statement)The CASE statement selects a set of actions based on an atomic selectorvalue; its syntax is:@Begin(ProgramExample)(@B[CASE]     &lt;selector&gt; @B[OF]          (&lt;case@-[1]&gt; &lt;action@-[11]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[1i]&gt;)          (&lt;case@-[2]&gt; &lt;action@-[21]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[2j]&gt;)          ...          @P[ELSE]   &lt;action@-[m1]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[mk]&gt;)@End(ProgramExample)The @PE[&lt;selector&gt;] is evaluated, and is compared with the given@PE[&lt;case&gt;] specifications.  Each @PE[&lt;case&gt;] specification is eithera single, atomic specification, or a list of atomic specifications.All @PE[&lt;case&gt;] specifications are assumed to be quoted.  The "ELSE"clause is optional; the "ELSE" actions are executed if @PE[&lt;selector&gt;]does not match any @PE[&lt;case&gt;].If the @I[ type ] of the @PE[&lt;selector&gt;] has a VALUES specification,@PE[&lt;case&gt;] specifications which match the VALUES for that type willbe translated into the corresponding values.@Subsection(FOR Statement)The FOR statement generates a loop through a set of elements (typicallya list).  Two syntaxes of the FOR statement are provided:@Begin(ProgramExample)(@B[FOR EACH] &lt;set&gt; @P[DO] &lt;action@-[1]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[n]&gt;)(@B[FOR] &lt;variable&gt; @B[IN] &lt;set&gt; @P[DO] &lt;action@-[1]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;action@-[n]&gt;)@End(ProgramExample)The keyword "DO" is optional.  In the first form of the FOR statement,the singular form of the &lt;set&gt; is specified; GLISP will convert thegiven set name to the plural form.@Foot[For names with irregular plurals, the plural form should be puton the property list of the singular form under the property namePLURAL, e.g., @PE&lt;(PUTPROP 'MAN 'PLURAL 'MEN)&gt;.]The &lt;set&gt; may be qualified by anadjective or predicate phrase in the first form; the allowable syntaxesfor such qualifying phrases are shown below:@Begin(ProgramExample)&lt;set&gt; @B[WITH] &lt;predicate&gt;&lt;set&gt; @B[WHICH IS] &lt;adjective&gt;&lt;set&gt; @B[WHO IS]   &lt;adjective&gt;&lt;set&gt; @B[THAT IS]  &lt;adjective&gt;@End(ProgramExample)The &lt;predicate&gt; and &lt;adjective&gt; phrases may be combined with AND, OR, NOT,and grouping parentheses.  These phrases may be followed by a qualifyingphrase of the form:@Begin(ProgramExample)@B[WHEN] &lt;expression&gt;@End(ProgramExample)The "WHEN" expression is ANDed with the other qualifying expressions todetermine when the loop body will be executed.Within the FOR loop, the current member ofthe &lt;set&gt; which is being examined is automatically put into @I[context]at the highest level of priority.For example, suppose that the current context contains a substructurewhose description is:@Begin(ProgramExample)(PLUMBERS (LISTOF EMPLOYEE))@END(ProgramExample)Assuming that EMPLOYEE contains the appropriate definitions, thefollowing FOR loop could be written:@Begin(ProgramExample)(FOR EACH PLUMBER WHO IS NOT A TRAINEE DO SALARY &larr;+ 1.50)@End(ProgramExample)To simplify the collection of features of a group of objects, the&lt;action&gt;s in the FOR loop may be replaced by the CLISP-like construct:@Begin(ProgramExample)      ... @B[COLLECT] &lt;form&gt;)@End(ProgramExample)@Subsection(WHILE Statement)The format of the WHILE statement is as follows:@Begin(ProgramExample)   (@B[WHILE] &lt;condition&gt; @B[DO] &lt;action@-[1]&gt; ... &lt;action@-[n]&gt;)@End(ProgramExample)The actions @PE(&lt;action@-[1]&gt;) through @PE(&lt;action@-[n]&gt;) are executedrepeatedly as long as @PE(&lt;condition&gt;) is true.  The keyword @B[DO]may be omitted.  The value of the expression is NIL.@Subsection(REPEAT Statement)The format of the REPEAT statement is as follows:@Begin(ProgramExample)   (@B[REPEAT] &lt;action@-[1]&gt; ... &lt;action@-[n]&gt; @B[UNTIL] &lt;condition&gt;)@End(ProgramExample)The actions @PE(&lt;action@-[1]&gt;) through @PE(&lt;action@-[n]&gt;) are repeated(always at least once) until @PE[&lt;condition&gt;] is true.  The value ofthe expression is NIL.  The keyword @B[UNTIL] is required.@Section(Definite Reference to Particular Objects)In order to simplify reference to particular member(s) of a group,definite reference may be used.  Such an expression is written usingthe word @B[THE] followed by the singular form of the group,or @B[THOSE] followed by the plural form of the group, andqualifying phrases (as described for the @B[FOR] statement).The following examples illustrate these expressions.@Begin(ProgramExample)   (THE SLOT WITH SLOTNAME = NAME)   (THOSE EMPLOYEES WITH JOBTITLE = 'ELECTRICIAN)@End(ProgramExample)The value of @B[THE] is a single object (or NIL if no object satisfiesthe specified conditions); @B[THOSE] produces a list of all objectssatisfying the conditions.@Foot[In general, nested loops are optimizedso that intermediate lists are not actually constructed.  Therefore,use of nested THE or THOSE statements is not inefficient.]@Chapter(Messages)GLISP supports the @I[Message] metaphor, which has its roots in thelanguages SIMULA and SMALLTALK.  These languages provide@I[Object-Centered Programming], in which objects are thought of asbeing active entities which communicate by sending each other@I[Messages].  The internal structures of objects are hidden; a programwhich wishes to access "variables" of an object does so by sendingmessages to the object requesting the access desired.  Each objectcontains@Foot[typically by inheritance from some parent in a Class hierarchy]a list of @I[Selectors], which identify the messages to which the objectcan respond.  A @I[Message] specifies the destination object, theselector, and any arguments associated with the message.  When amessage is executed at runtime, the selector is looked up for thedestination object; associated with the selector is a procedure, whichis executed with the destination object and message arguments as itsarguments.GLISP treats reference to properties, adjectives, and predicatesassociated with an object similarly to the way it treats messages.The compiler is able to perform much of the lookup of @I[selectors]at compile time, resulting in efficient code while maintaining theflexibility of themessage metaphor.  Messages can be defined in such a way that theycompile open, compile as function calls to the function which isassociated with the selector, or compile as messages to be interpretedat runtime.Sending of a @I[message] in GLISP is specified using the following syntax:@Begin(ProgramExample)@B[(SEND] &lt;object&gt; &lt;selector&gt; &lt;arg@-[1]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;arg@-[n]&gt;@B[)]@End(ProgramExample)The keyword "SEND" may be replaced by "@B[@PE(&larr;)]".  The @PE[&lt;selector&gt;]is assumed to be quoted.  Zero or more arguments may be specified;the arguments other than @PE[&lt;selector&gt;] are evaluated.@PE[&lt;object&gt;] is evaluated; if @PE[&lt;object&gt;] is a non-atomic expression,it must be enclosed in at least one set of parantheses, so that the@PE[&lt;selector&gt;] will always be the third element of the list.@SECTION(Compilation of Messages)When GLISP encounters a message statement, it looks up the &lt;selector&gt;in the MSG definition of the type of the object to which the messageis sent, or in one of the SUPERS of the type.@Foot[If an appropriate representation language is provided, the&lt;selector&gt; and its associated &lt;response&gt;may be inherited from a parent class in the class hierarchy of therepresentation language.]Each &lt;selector&gt; is paired with the appropriate &lt;response&gt; to the message.Code is compiled depending on the formof the &lt;response&gt; associated with the &lt;selector&gt;, as follows:@Foot[If the type of the destination object is unknown, or if the&lt;selector&gt; cannot be found, GLISP compiles the (SEND@ ...) statementas if it is a normal function call.]@Begin(Enumerate)If the &lt;response&gt; is an atom, that atom is taken as the name of afunction which is to be called in response to the message.  The codewhich is compiled is a direct call to this function,@Begin(ProgramExample)(&lt;response&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;arg@-[1]&gt; ... &lt;arg@-[n]&gt;)@End(ProgramExample)If the &lt;response&gt; is a list, the contents of the list are recursivelycompiled in-line as GLISP code, with the name "@PE[self]" artificially"bound" to the &lt;object&gt; to which the message was sent.  Because thecompilation is recursive, a message may be defined in terms of othermessages, substructures, or properties, which may themselves be definedas messages.@Foot[Such recursive definitions must of course be acyclic.]The outer pair of parentheses of the &lt;response&gt; serves only to boundits contents; thus, if the &lt;response&gt; is a function call, the functioncall must be enclosed in an additional set of parentheses.@End(Enumerate)The following examples illustrate the various ways of defining messageresponses.@Begin(ProgramExample)(EDIT         EDITV)(SUCCESSOR    (self + 1))(MAGNITUDE    ((SQRT X*X + Y*Y)))@End(ProgramExample)In the first example, a message with &lt;selector&gt; EDIT iscompiled as a direct call to the function EDITV.  In thesecond example, the SUCCESSOR message is compiled as the sum ofthe object receiving the message (represented by "@PE[self]") and theconstant 1; if the object receiving the message is the value of thevariable J and has the type INTEGER, the code generatedfor the SUCCESSOR would be @PE[(ADD1 J)].  The third example illustratesa call to a function, SQRT, with arguments containing definitereferences to X and Y (which presumably are defined as part of theobject whose MAGNITUDE is sought).  Note that since MAGNITUDE isdefined by a function call, an "extra" pair of parentheses isrequired around the function call to distinguish it from in-line code.The user can determine whether a message is to be compiled open,compiled as a function call, or compiled as a message which is tobe executed at runtime.When a GLISP expression is specified as a &lt;response&gt;, the &lt;response&gt;is always compiled open; open compilation can be requested by usingthe OPEN property when the &lt;response&gt; is a function name.Open compilation operates likemacro expansion; since the "macro" is a GLISP expression, it is easyto define messages and properties in terms of other messages andproperties.  The combined capabilities of open compilation, messageinheritance, conditional compilation, and flexible assignment providea great deal of power.The ability to use definite reference in GLISP makesthe definition and use of the "macros" simple and natural.@Section(Compilation of Properties and Adjectives)Properties, Adjectives, and ISA-adjectives are compiled in thesame way as Messages.  Since the syntax of use of properties andadjectives does not permit specification of any arguments, the onlyargument available to code or a function which implements the@PE[&lt;response&gt;] for a property or adjective is the @PE[ self ]argument, which denotes the object to which the property or adjectiveapplies.  A @PE[&lt;response&gt;] which is written directly as GLISP codemay use the name @PE[ self ] directly@Foot[The name @PE&lt; self &gt; is "declared" by the compiler, and doesnot have to be specified in the Structure Description.], as in theSUCCESSOR example above; a function which is specified as the@PE[&lt;response&gt;] will be called with the @PE[self]object as its single argument.@Section(Declarations for Message Compilation)Declarations which affect compilation of Messages, Adjectives, orProperties may be specified following the &lt;response&gt; for a givenmessage; such declarations are in (Interlisp) property-list format,@PE[&lt;prop@-[1]&gt;&lt;value@-[1]&gt;@ ...@ &lt;prop@-[n]&gt;&lt;value@-[n]&gt;].  Thefollowing declarations may be specified:@Begin(Enumerate)@B[RESULT]@PE[ &lt;type&gt;]@*This declaration specifies the @I[type] of the result of themessage or other property.  Specification of result types helps thecompiler to perform type inference, thus reducing the number of typedeclarations needed in user programs.The RESULT type for simple GLISP expressions will be inferred by thecompiler; the RESULT declaration should be used if the @PE[&lt;response&gt;]is a complex GLISP expression or a function name.@Foot[Alternatively, the result of a function may be specified by theRESULT declaration within the function itself.]@ @B[OPEN@ @ T]@*This declaration specifies that the function which is specified as the&lt;response&gt; is to be compiled open at each reference.  A &lt;response&gt;which is a list of GLISP code is always compiled open; however, sucha &lt;response&gt; can have only the @PE[self] argument.  If it is desired tocompile open a Message &lt;response&gt; which has arguments besides @PE[self],the &lt;response&gt; must be coded as a function (in order to bind thearguments) and the OPEN declaration must be used.Functions which are compiled open may not be recursive via any chainof open-compiled functions.@B[MESSAGE@ @ T]@*This declaration specifies that a runtime message should be generatedfor messages with this &lt;selector&gt; sent to objects of this Class.Typically, such a declaration would be used in a higher-level Classwhose subclasses have different responses to the same message&lt;selector&gt;.@End(Enumerate)@Section(Operator Overloading)GLISP provides operator overloading for user-defined objects usingthe Message facility.  If an arithmetic operator is defined as the@I[selector] of a message for a user datatype, an arithmeticsubexpression using that operator will be compiled as if it werea message call with two arguments.  For example, the type VECTORmight have the declaration and function definitions below:@Begin(ProgramExample)(GLISPOBJECTS   (VECTOR  (CONS (X INTEGER) (Y INTEGER))      MSG  ((+  VECTORPLUS OPEN T)            (&larr;+ VECTORINCR OPEN T)) )    )(DEFINEQ   (VECTORPLUS (GLAMBDA (U,V:VECTOR)       (A VECTOR WITH X = U:X + V:X , Y = U:Y + V:Y) ))   (VECTORINCR (GLAMBDA (U,V:VECTOR)       (U:X &larr;+ V:X)       (U:Y &larr;+ V:Y) ))    )@End(ProgramExample)With these definitions, an expression involving the operators @PE[+]or @PE[&larr;+] will be compiled by open compilation of the respectivefunctions.The compound operators (@PE[&larr;+ +&larr; &larr;- -&larr;]) are conventionally thought of as"destructive replacement" operators; thus, the expression@PE[(U@ &larr;@ U@ +@ V)] will create a new VECTOR structure and assignthe new structure to U, while the expression @PE[(U@ &larr;+@ V)] willsmash the existing structure U, given the definitions above.The convention of letting the compound operators specify "destructivereplacement" allows the user to specify both the destructive andnon-destructive cases.  However, if the compound operators are notoverloaded but the arithmetic operators @PE[+] and @PE[-] areoverloaded, the compound operators are compiled using the definitionsof @PE[+] for @PE[&larr;+] and @PE[+&larr;], and @PE[-] for @PE[&larr;-] and @PE[-&larr;].Thus, if only the @PE[+] operator were overloaded for VECTOR, theexpression @PE[(U@ &larr;+@ V)] would be compiled as if it were@PE[(U@ &larr;@ U@ +@ V)].@Section(Runtime Interpretation of Messages)In some cases, the type of the object which will receive a given messageis not known at compile time; in such cases, the message must beexecuted interpretively, at runtime.  Interpretiveexecution is provided for all types of GLISP messages.An interpretive message call (i.e., a call to the function @PE[SEND])is generated by the GLISP compiler in response to a message call ina GLISP program when the specified message selector cannot be foundfor the declared type of the object receiving the message, or whenthe MESSAGE flag is set for that selector.  Alternatively, a call toSEND may be entered interactively by the user or may be contained ina function which has not been compiled by GLISP.Messages can be interpreted only for those objects which are representedas one of the OBJECT types, since it is necessary that the objectcontain a pointer to its CLASS.  The &lt;selector&gt; of the message islooked up in the MSG declarations of the CLASS; if it is not foundthere, the SUPERS of the CLASS are examined (depth-first) until theselector is found.  The &lt;response&gt; associated with the &lt;selector&gt; isthen examined.  If the &lt;response&gt; is a function name, that function issimply called with the specified arguments.@Foot{The object to whichthe message is sent is always inserted as the first argument, followedby the other arguments specified in the message call.}  If the&lt;response&gt; is a GLISP expression, the expression is compiled as aLAMBDA form and cached for future use.Interpretive execution is available for other property types (PROP,ADJ, and ISA) using the call:@Programexample[(SENDPROP &lt;object&gt; &lt;selector&gt; &lt;proptype&gt;)]where @PE[&lt;proptype&gt;] is PROP, ADJ, or ISA.  @PE[&lt;proptype&gt;] is notevaluated.@Chapter(Context Rules and Reference)The ability to use definite reference to features of objects whichare in @I[Context] is the key to much of GLISP's power.  At thesame time, definite reference introduces the possibility of ambiguity,i.e., there could be more than one object in Context which hasa feature with a specified name.  In this chapter, guidelines arepresented for use of definite reference to allow the user to avoidambiguity.@Section(Organization of Context)The Context maintained by the compiler is organized in levels, eachof which may have multiple entries; the sequence oflevels is a stack.  Searching of the Contextproceeds from the top (nearest) level of the stack to the bottom(farthest) level.  The bottom level of the stack is composed of theLAMBDA variables of the function being compiled.  New levelsare added to the Context in the following cases:@Begin(Enumerate)When a PROG is compiled.  The PROG variables are added to the newlevel.When a @B[For] loop is compiled.  The "loop index" variable (which maybe either a user variable or a compiler variable) is added to thenew level, so that it is in context during the loop.When a @B[While] loop is compiled.When a new clause of an @B[If] statement is compiled.@End(Enumerate)When a Message, Property, or Adjective is compiled, that compilationtakes place in a @I[ new ] context consisting only of the @PE[ self ]argument and other message arguments.@Section(Rules for Using Definite Reference)The possibility of referential ambiguity is easily controlled in practice.First, it should be noted that the traditional methods of uniquenaming and complete path specification ("PASCAL style")are available, and should beused whenever there is any possibility of ambiguity.  Second, thereare several cases which are guaranteed to be unambiguous:@Begin(Enumerate)In compiling GLISP code which implements a Message, Property, orAdjective, only the @PE[@ self@ ] argument is in context initially;definite reference to any substructure or property of the objectis therefore unambiguous.@Foot[Unless there are duplicated names in the object definition.However, if the same name is used as both a Property and an Adjective,for example, it is not considered a duplicate since Properties andAdjectives are specified by different source language constructs.]@ Within a @B[For] loop, the loop variable is the closest thing incontext.In many cases, a function will only have a single structured argument;in such cases, definite reference is unambiguous.@End(Enumerate)If "PASCAL" syntax (or the equivalent English-like form) is used forreferences other than the above cases, no ambiguities will occur.@Section(Type Inference)In order to interpret definite references to features of objects,the compiler must know the @I[ types ] of the objects.  However,explicit type specification can be burdensome, and makes it difficultto change types without rewriting existing type declarations.The GLISP compiler performs type inference in many cases, relievingthe programmer of the burden of specifying types explicitly.  Thefollowing rules enable the programmer to know when types will beinferred by the compiler.@Begin(Enumerate)Whenever a variable is set to a value whose type is known,the type of the variableis inferred to be the type of the value to which it was set.If a variable whose initial type was NIL (e.g., an untyped PROG variable)appears on the left-hand side of the @PE[@ &larr;+@ ] operator, its typeis inferred to be @PE[(LISTOF@ &lt;type&gt;)], where @PE[@ &lt;type&gt;@ ] isthe type of the right-hand side of the @PE[@ &larr;+@ ] expression.Whenever a substructure of a structured object is retrieved, the typeof the substructure is retrieved also.Types of infix expressions are inferred.Types of Properties, Adjectives, and Messages are inferred if:@Begin(Enumerate)The @PE[ &lt;response&gt; ] is GLISP code whose type can be inferred.The @PE[ &lt;response&gt; ] has a RESULT declaration associated with it.The @PE[ &lt;response&gt; ] is a function whose definition includes aRESULT declaration, or whose property list contains a GLRESULTTYPEdeclaration.@End(Enumerate)The type of the "loop variable" in a @B[For] loop is inferred and isadded to a new level of Context by the compiler.If an @B[If] statement tests the type of a variable using a @PE[@ self@ ]adjective, the variable is inferred to be of that type if the test issatisfied.  Similar type inference is performed if the test of the typeof the variable is the condition of a @B[While] statement.When possible, GLISP infers the type of the function it is compilingand adds the type of the result to the property list of the functionname under the indicator GLRESULTTYPE.The types returned by many standard Lisp functions are known by thecompiler.@End(Enumerate)@Chapter(GLISP and Knowledge Representation Languages)GLISP provides a convenient @I[Access Language] which allows uniformspecification of access to objects, without regard to the way inwhich the objects are actually stored; in addition, GLISP providesa basic @I[Representation Language], in which the structures andproperties of objects can be declared.  The field of ArtificialIntelligence has spawned a number of powerful RepresentationLanguages, which provide power in describing large numbers of objectclasses by allowing hierarchies of @I[Class] descriptions, in whichinstances of Classes can inherit properties and procedures fromparent Classes.  The @I[Access Languages] provided for these RepresentationLanguages, however, have typically been rudimentary, often being nomore than variations of LISP's GETPROP and PUTPROP.  In addition,by performing inheritance of procedures and data values at runtime,these Representation Languages have often been computationally costly.Facilities are provided for interfacing GLISP with representationlanguages of the user's choice.  When this is done,GLISP provides a convenient and uniform language foraccessing both objects in the Representation Language and LISP objects.In addition, GLISP can greatly improve the efficiency of programs whichaccess the representations by performing lookup of procedures and datain the Class hierarchy @I[at compile time].  Finally, a LISP structurecan be specified @I[as the way of implementing] instances of a Classin the Representation Language, so that while the objects in such aclass appear the same as other objects in the Representation Languageand are accessed in the same way, they are actually implemented asLISP objects which are efficient in both time and storage.A clean@Foot[Cleanliness is in the eye of the beholder and, being next toGodliness, difficult to attain.  However, it's @I(relatively) clean.]interface between GLISP and a Representation Language is provided.With such an interface, each @I[Class] in the Representation Languageis acceptable as a GLISP @I[type].  When the program which is beingcompiled specifies an access to an object which is known to be amember of some Class, the interface module for the RepresentationLanguage is called to generate code to perform the access.  Theinterface module can perform inheritance within the Class hierarchy,and can call GLISP compiler functions to compile code forsubexpressions.  Properties, Adjectives, and Messages in GLISP formatcan be added to Class definitions, and can be inherited by subclassesat compile time.  In an Object-Centered representation language orother representation language which relies heavily on proceduralinheritance, substantial improvements in execution speed can beachieved by performing the inheritance lookup at compile time andcompiling direct procedure calls to inherited procedures when theprocedures are static and the type of the object which inherits theprocedure is known at compile time.Specifications for an interface module for GLISP are contained in aseparate document@Foot[to be written.].  To date, GLISP has beeninterfaced to our own GIRL representation language, and to LOOPS.@Foot[LOOPS, a LISP Object Oriented Programming System, is beingdeveloped at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center by Dan Bobrow andyMark Stefik.]@Chapter(Obtaining and Using GLISP)GLISP and its documentation are available free of charge over theARPANET.

However, in order toavoid having code which was intended as "ordinary lisp" interpretedas GLISP code, it is necessary to follow certain conventions whenwriting "ordinary lisp" code.@Subsection(Reserved Characters)The colon and the characters which represent the arithmetic operatorsshould not be used within atom names, since GLISP splits apart "atoms"which contain operators.  The set of characters to be avoided withinatom names is:@Programexample{+ * / &uarr; &larr; ~ = &lt; &gt; : ' ,}The character "minus" (@PE[ - ]) is permitted within atom names unlessthe flag @PE[GLSEPMINUS] is set.Some GLISP constructs permit (but donot require) use of the character "comma" (@PE[ , ]); since the commais used as a "backquote" character in some Lisp dialects, the user maywish to avoid its use.  When used in Lisp dialects which use comma asa backquote character, all commas must be "escaped" or "slashified";this makes porting of GLISP code containing commas more difficult.@Subsection(Reserved Function Names)Most GLISP function, variable, and property names begin with "@PE[GL]"to avoid conflict with user names.  Those "function" names which areused in GLISP constructs or in interpretive functions should beavoided.  This set includes the following names:@Programexample{A           AN          CASE         FOR         IFREPEAT      SEND        SENDPROP     THE         WHILE}@SUBSECTION(Other Reserved Names)Words which are used within GLISP constructs should be avoided asvariable names.

The following examples illustrate how thiscan be done.@Begin(ProgramExample)(GLDEFSTRQ(ArithmeticOperator  (self ATOM)   PROP ((Precedence OperatorPrecedenceFn  RESULT INTEGER)         (PrintForm  ((GETPROP self 'PRINTFORM) or self)) )   MSG  ((PRIN1      ((PRIN1 the PrintForm)))) )(IntegerMod7         (self INTEGER)   PROP ((Modulus    (7))         (Inverse    ((If self is ZERO then 0                            else (Modulus - self))) ))   ADJ  ((Even       ((ZEROP (LOGAND self 1))))         (Odd        (NOT Even)))   ISA  ((Prime      PrimeTestFn))   MSG  ((+          IMod7Plus  OPEN T  RESULT IntegerMod7)         (&larr;          IMod7Store OPEN T  RESULT IntegerMod7)) ))(DEFINEQ(IMod7Store  (GLAMBDA (LHS:IntegerMod7 RHS:INTEGER)         (LHS:self &larr;&larr; (IREMAINDER RHS Modulus)) ))(IMod7Plus   (GLAMBDA (X,Y:IntegerMod7)         (IREMAINDER (X:self + Y:self) X:Modulus) )))@End(ProgramExample)A few subtleties of the function IMod7Store are worth noting.First, the left-hand-side expression used in storing the result isLHS:self rather than simply LHS.  LHS and LHS:self of course referto the same actual structure; however, the @I[type] of LHS isIntegerMod7, while the type of LHS:self is INTEGER.  If LHS wereused on the left-hand side, since the @PE[ &larr; ] operator isoverloaded for IntegerMod7, the function IMod7Store would be invokedagain to perform its own function; since the function is compiledOPEN, this would be an infinite loop.  A second subtlety is that theassignment to LHS:self must use the self-assignment operator, @PE[@ &larr;&larr;@ ],since it is desired to perform assignment as seen "outside" thefunction IMod7Store, i.e., in the environment in which the originalassignment operation was specified.@Section(Disjunctive Types)LISP programming often involves objects which may in fact be ofdifferent types, but which are for some purposes treated alike.For example, LISP data structures are typically constructed ofCONS cells whose fields may point to other CONS cells or to ATOMs.The GLISP Structure Description language does not permit the userto specify that a certain field of a structure is a CONS cell @P[or]an ATOM.  However, it is possible to create a GLISP datatype whichencompasses both.  Typically, this is done by declaring the structureof the object to be the complex structure, and testing for thesimpler structure explicitly.  This is illustrated for the case ofthe LISP tree below.@Begin(ProgramExample)   (LISPTREE  (CONS (CAR LISPTREE) (CDR LISPTREE))      ADJ    ((EMPTY     (@R&lt;~&gt;self)))      PROP   ((LEFTSON   ((If self is ATOMIC then NIL else CAR)))              (RIGHTSON  ((If self is ATOMIC then NIL else CDR)))))@End(ProgramExample)@Section(Generators)Often, one would like to define such properties of an object as theway of enumerating its parts in some order.  Such thingscannot be specified directly as properties of the object because theydepend on the previous state of the enumeration.  However, it ispossible to define an object, associated with the original datatype,which contains the state of the enumeration and responds to Messages.This is illustrated below by an object which searches a tree in Preorder.@Begin(ProgramExample)(PreorderSearchRecord  (CONS (Node LISPTREE)                             (PreviousNodes (LISTOF LISPTREE)))   MSG  ((NEXT  ((PROG (TMP)                    (If TMP&larr;Node:LEFTSON                        then (If Node:RIGHTSON                                 then PreviousNodes+&larr;Node)                             Node&larr;TMP                        else TMP-&larr;PreviousNodes                             Node&larr;TMP:RIGHTSON) ))))(TP (GLAMBDA ((A LISPTREE))      (PROG (PSR)         (PSR &larr; (A PreorderSearchRecord                   with Node = (the LISPTREE)))         (While Node (If Node is ATOMIC (PRINT Node))                     (&larr; PSR NEXT)) )))@End(ProgramExample)The object class PreorderSearchRecord serves two purposes: it holdsthe state of the enumeration, and it responds to messages to stepthrough the enumeration.  With these definitions, it is easy to writea program involving enumeration of a LISPTREE, as illustrated bythe example function TP above.  By being open-compiled, messages toan object can be as efficient as in-line hand coding; yet, the codefor the messages only has to be written once, and can easily bechanged without changing the programs which use the messages.@Chapter(Program Examples)In this chapter, examples of GLISP object declarations and programsare presented.  Each example is discussed as a section of thischapter; the code for the examples and the code produced by thecompiler are shown for each example at the end of the chapter.@Section(GLTST1 File)The GLTST1 file illustrates the use of several types of LISPstructures, and the use of fairly complex Property definitionsfor objects.  SENIORITY of an EMPLOYEE, for example, is definedin terms of the YEAR of DATE-HIRED, which is a substructure ofEMPLOYEE, and the YEAR of the function (CURRENTDATE).@Foot[The @I&lt;type&gt; of (CURRENTDATE) must be known to the compiler,either by compiling it first, or by including a RESULT declarationin the function definition of CURRENTDATE, or by specifying theGLRESULTTYPE property for the function name.]@Section(GLTST2 File)The GLTST2 file illustrates the use of Messages for ordinary LISPobjects.  By defining the arithmetic operators as Message selectorsfor the object VECTOR, use of vectors in arithmetic expressionsis enabled; OPEN compilation is specified for these messages.The definition of GRAPHICSOBJECT uses VECTORs as components.While the actual structure of a GRAPHICSOBJECT is simple,numerous properties are defined for user convenience.The definition of CENTER is easily stated as a VECTOR expression.The Messages of GRAPHICSOBJECT illustrate how different responsesto a message for different types of objects can be achieved, eventhough for GLISP compilation of messages to LISP objects the codefor a message must be resolved at compile time.@Foot[For objects in a Representation Language, messages may becompiled directly as LISP code or as messages to be interpreted atruntime, depending on how much is known about the object to which themessage is sent and the compilation declarations in effect.]The DRAW andERASE messages get the function to be used from the property listof the SHAPE name of the GRAPHICSOBJECT and APPLY it to draw thedesired object.MOVINGGRAPHICSOBJECT contains a GRAPHICSOBJECT as a TRANSPARENTcomponent, so that it inherits the properties of a GRAPHICSOBJECT;a MOVINGGRAPHICSOBJECT is a GRAPHICSOBJECT which has a VELOCITY,and will move itself by the amount of its velocity upon the messagecommand STEP.@Foot[This example is adapted from the MovingPointexample written by Dan Bobrow for LOOPS.]The compilation of the message@PE[(&larr;@ MGO@ STEP)] in the function TESTFN1 is of particularinterest.  This message is expandedinto the sending of the message @PE[(&larr;@ self@ MOVE@ VELOCITY)]to the MOVINGGRAPHICSOBJECT.  The MOVINGGRAPHICSOBJECT cannot respondto such a message; however, since it contains a GRAPHICSOBJECT as aTRANSPARENT component, its GRAPHICSOBJECT responds to the message.@Foot[TRANSPARENT substructures thus permit procedural inheritance byLISP objects.]A GRAPHICSOBJECT responds to a MOVE message byerasing itself, increasing its START point by the (vector) distanceto be moved, andthen redrawing itself.  All of the messages are specified as beingcompiled open, so that the short original message actually generatesa large amount of code.A rectangle is drawn by the function DRAWRECT.  Note how the use ofthe properties defined for a GRAPHICSOBJECT allows an easy interfaceto the system functions MOVETO and DRAWTO in terms of the propertiesLEFT, RIGHT, TOP, and BOTTOM.</pre>
