PageFullCtrl					D.G. Bobrow  June 1982This LISPUSERS package is useful for controlling the scrolling behavior of the TTY typescript window.  If it is loaded, then PAGEFULLFN is advised to continue scrolling at page boundaries unless the CTRL key is down.If CTRL is down, the typescript output will be stopped at page boundaries until the CTRL is raised.  If while holding the CTRL down, the user can hit LSHIFT to keep the typescript window in this state without holding down the CTRL key.  Typing any character after that releases the typescript window to accept further characters.</pre>
