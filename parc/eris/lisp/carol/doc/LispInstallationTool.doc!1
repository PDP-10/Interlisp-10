LOADING INTERLISP-D ON THE 1108 B.	LOADING INTERLISP-D SOFTWARE.C.	YOUR USER.CM FILED.	SOME DEFAULT SETTINGA.	LOADING INTERLISP-D ON THE 1108 SIPThe 1108 comes with three different disk configurations: the 10 Megabyte SA1000, the 29 Megabyte SA4000, and the 43 Megabyte Q2000. Some software must be pre-loaded onto your 1108 system before you can use it.  PRE-LOADING WITH DIAGNOSTICS FILES.The following floppies are required: (1) The Installation Utility; (2) Diagnostics File.1.  Load the Installation Utility in the floppy drive and do a 2-boot.  (A 2-boot is done by press both the B RESET and ALT B buttons on the front panel and release the B RESET button immediately.  Release the ALT B button when the font panel reads 0002.)  After about two minutes a list of utility options will be displayed.2.  Select menu item "Install Diagnostics".3.  Unload the floppy drive and load the "Diagnostics File" floppy.4.  Respond to the prompt on the display with Y.5.  When the Installation menu reappears, perform a 1-boot.6.  In about 2 minutes, the Tajo environment will be running.  Activate the Exec window in the bottom left hand corner.  The screen will be configured to accept typein.  Press any mouse button to activate the input cursor.  You are now ready to begin typing.7.  Unload the floppy drive and insert the Installation Utility floppy.8.  Type in  "floppy read InstallLispTool.bcd ".  You should be able to hear the floppy drive, as the file InstallLispTool.bcd is transferred from the floppy disk to the rigid disk.  9.  Type InstallLispTool <CR> at your exec window.10.  Do a 1-boot.  This should get you to the bouncing square on your display.B.	LOADING INTERLISP-D SOFTWARE.There are two ways to load your Interlisp-D software.  The first way is to load from floppy disketts that are distributted to you the second way is to load  from your file server.Loading Interlisp-D from your floppies:1.	Place the "Installation Utility" disk in you floppy disk drive and do a 2-boot.2.	When the Installation menu comes up, select the item labelled "Install Interlisp on Lisp/x volume". Note for the 29MB and 43MB disks, you have three lisp volumes, the Lisp, Lisp2 and Lisp3. For the 10MB disk you only have Lisp volume.3.	Follow through the dialog to load your Interlisp-D floppies.  For different Lisp sysout files you can have from three to five floppies.4.	After Interlisp is loaded, you may select "Start Interlisp from Lisp/x volume" option or you may exit by doing a 1-boot.        Loading Interlisp-D from your file server.THE LIT (Lisp Installation Tool)  allows you to install Interlisp-D software from a file server.    The tool is activated when you have a Interlisp-D bouncing box on your CRT.  If you dont have the bouncing square, then make sure you have done the pre-loading software correctly.To activate the tool, click the left button of your mouse as indicated on your DMT box.There is also the Versatec's Online Diagnostics tool that can be activated from the bouncing box state, by clicking the right button.  Users unfamiliar with mouse and window operations should read the Help function in the Diagnostics tool which presents detailed instructions on this kind interface.	The LIT is a window based tool and is composed of five regions.  The 1)Herald name, 2)Message Subwindow, 3)Parameter Subwindow, 4)Command Subwindow and 5)File Subwindow.The Herald name appears at the top line and it merely indicates the tool's name and its creation date.The Message subwindow displays the error messages, if any, that are encountered in the command operation.	The Parameter subwindow is a form subwindow and currently contains the following paramters:	       	Doc.:{General, ErrorMsg}	Device: {IFS, NS, FLOPPY}	VMem Size = 	File: [Host]<Directory>SubDirectory>fileName.sysout	Volume Menu:							Volume Size = 	User:				Password:			Free Size = 	Domain:				Organization:	The Command subwindow is another form subwindow and currently contains the following commands:	Install File!	Boot!		Erase!		Set VMem!	Help!	Remote List!	Copy VMem!	Scavenge!	Floppy!		Quit!		The File subwindow displays the event messages relevant to that command.PARAMETER ITEMS:	Doc.:	The document parameter is an enumerated item which is used in conjunction with the Help command.  It is used to select which online document is to be displayed in the file subwindow for a quick reference.  'General' displays the overall features of the tool, while the 'ErrorMsg' displays the semantics of the error messages in the tool.	Device:	Device is another enumerated item which gives user the selection of the type of device where the lisp sysout file is located.  Currently, two types of file servers, IFS(Interum File Server) & XNS(Xerox Network System) are supported.  An additional Floppy device on your Dandelion is planned for reading sysout floppies into the lisp volume.	File:	File specifies the pathname of the file to be installed.  The syntax of the complete pathname depends on the particular file system on your host machine.		For example, on a Xerox's IFS the pathname looks like [Host]<Directory>[SubDirectory>]FileName.ext!version.  	A typical example would be [Rosebowl]<Lisp>Fugue>Lisp.sysout.	On a Xerox's product file server the pathname looks like [Host:Domain:Organization]<Directory>[SubDirectory>]FileName.ext!version.  	A typical example would be [Phylex:XSIS North:Xerox]<Demo>Demo.sysout	An equivalent but shorter way would be [Phylex:]<Demos>Demo.sysout	On a Unix file server the pathname looks like [host]/directory[subdirectory/]/filename.ext  	A typical example would be [safe]/a/lisp/fugue4/lisp.sysout		On a VAX-VMS file server the pathname looks like [Host]<Directory[.SubDirectory]>FileName.ext;version.  	A typical example would be [Taos]<DEIProd.Prior]Lisp.sys	On a DEC-2060 TOPS-20 file server, the pathname looks like [Host]<Directory[.SubDirectory]>FileName.Sys.version.  	A typical example would be [Sumex-2060]<Dolphin.Fugue6.BetaTest>Lisp.sysout.  	 Volume Menu:	Volume Menu is another enumerated menu which only gets displayed by chording your mouse button(presing both buttons on a 2-button mouse or middle button on a 3-button mouse).  A menu with the exact volume names as configured in your machine will pop up.  If 'Lisp' volume is present in your machine, it will get selected as the default volume else nothing gets selected.  To change your volume selection, simply move your mouse to the volume desired and click the left-button. 	VMem Size:	VMem Size dynamically shows the size in pages(1 page=512 bytes) of your Interlisp's virtual memory size on that volume.  This parameter is only meaningful to a lisp-type volume.		Volume Size:	Volume Size dynamically shows the volume size in pages.			Free Size:  Free Size dynamically shows the available size in pages.	User:		is your Pup/NS registered user name.	Password:	is your associated password for login.	Domain:		is your domain name as defined in your Clearinghouse database. Necessary for XNS service.	Organization:	is your organization name as defined in your Clearinghouse database. Necessary for XNS service.COMMAND ITEMS	Install File!:  Install file will fetch and load the file specified in the file parameter into the volume selected.  This command is to be used in conjunction with the device parameter in selecting the type of device where the file is located.  During processing, two positive indications are provided.  First, your command subwindow will be redisplayed by some twiddler graphic symbol, here star-symbol is used.  Secondly, the message subwindow will display the number of bytes which have been transfered to your disk.  This gives you an idea of how much longer the transfer will take.  Usually for a 2.5 megabytes file size in a local net, it takes in the neighborhood of 4-5 minutes.  This command is abortable by depressing the STOP key (the red key located on the right hand corner).		Copy VMem!: Copy VMem performs a cross-volume copy of the virtual memory backing store from one logical volume to another logical volume. Copy VMem pops up a separate window with two data parameters: Source Volume and Destination Volume.  Both of these are menu items and can be popped by chording on the parameter.  Two command items exist, Start and Quit.  'Start' starts the copy operation, 'Quit' deactivates the option window.  Again, two positive indicators are provided on this operation. They are the 'twiddling' graphic and the 'pages copied' information.  Note this command only copies the VMem size you specifed and not the entire volume contents. 	Boot!: 	Boot command is used to boot the volume selected.  Since different boot file is associated with your volume, this command currently requires you to specify the type of the volume you are booting.  Currently volumes are categorized as 'lisp' and 'non-lisp' volume types.		Set VMem!: Set VMem command is used to vary the size of the Interlisp's vitual memory backing store.  This command is drived by the size specified on the VMem Size parameter.  A warning message will be posed if you are trying to 'shrink' your virtual memory backing store.  If no size is specified on an empty volume, the default VMem will be used.  The default vMem will be 2000 pages less than your volume size.	Floppy!:  Floppy command will support floppy feaures on your Dandelion.  This is yet to be implemented.		Erase!:  Erase command is used to erase the contents of your volume.   This command is to be used whenerver a major system upgrade is to be perfromed.  This will convert the logical volume format of the volumes.			Scavenge!: Scavenge performs a file-scavenge on the volume selected.  This command is be used whenever you suspect the integrity of your disk volume.  It is recommended whenever you encounter strange behaviors on your system.  At the end of this operation, it produces a MSScavenge.log file in that volume.  Reading this file will reveal the damaged files which have been repaired if any.		Quit!:	Quit deactivates the window and returns the tool to the bouncing box state.       	C.	YOUR USER.CM FILE	The tool parses your user.cm file for some default setting.  In specific, "User", "Password", "Domain", "Organization" "File Server" and "File" parameters will be set if present in the user.cm file.  Below is a sample user.cm, you should modify the appropriate fileds for your convenience.[User.cm][System]User: UserNamePassword: YourPasswordDomain: DomainNameOrganization: OrganizationNameFileServer: NSNSFile: [Server:Domain:Organization]<Directory>SubDirectories>FileName.SysoutPUPFile: [Server]<Directory>SubDirectories>FileName.SysoutFloppyFile: Lisp.sysoutScreen: WhiteDebug: FALSE[Diagnostics:System]InitialCommand: LispInstallationTool D.	SOME DEFAULT SETTING	The volume parameter is defaulted to be "Lisp" if it is present in your physical volume else it is nil.	E.	PROFILE-TOOL	The Profile Tool enables the user to select a number of default parameters to be used when installing fresh Interlisp-D sysouts from a file server.  The defaults will appear in the Lisp Installation Tool window and may be changed there if necessary.		PARAMETER ITEMS:	User:		Your NS/Pup registered user name.		Password: 	Your NS/Pup registered password.  You do not have to supply this here, and you may type it into the Installation Tool window.		Domain:	Your domain name as defined in your Clearinghouse database. Necessary for XNS service.		Organization:	Your organization name as defined in your Clearinghouse database. Necessary for XNS service.		FileServer:	Specifies the default file server to be selected, i.e IFS or NS.		NSLisp: 	The complete file pathname on your NS file server.		PupLisp:	The complete file pathname on your IFS file server.		FloppyLisp:	The file name on the floppy disketts where lisp sysout is to be loaded.  This is not implemented yet.		 COMMAND ITEMS:	Start!		Start will create a user profile file on your disk.  Internal users should avoid using this, as it will DESTROY your old user.cm file.  You may instead type in these entries into your user.cm file under [system] section on your "tajo/diagnostics" volume.		Quit!:		Quit will deactivate the tool and return to the bouncing box state.
