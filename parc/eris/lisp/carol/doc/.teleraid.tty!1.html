&lt;2.2&gt; TeleRaid: a remote debugging aidThe 1108 has no Raid debugger (since Raid is written in BCPL), but doesprovide a low-level "TeleRaid" service when it would otherwise fall intoRAID.  When the machine is in TeleRaid, it can be debugged from anothermachine, or in some cases the user can issue commands to continue orbreak into the computation in limited ways.  1100s and 1132s can alsorun TeleRaid.Once a machine is in TeleRaid, then another may be used to debug it bycalling (TELERAID &lt;host&gt;), where &lt;host&gt; is the Pup name or number of themachine running the TeleRaid server.  The function TELERAID  is not inthe standard loadup (but is in the FULL.SYSOUT loadup); to load it, youmust load the files READSYS.DCOM, RDSYS.DCOM, VMEM.DCOM, andREMOTEVMEM.DCOM from &lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt;.  The  user interface for TELERAIDis similar to that of Raid; type ? for an enumeration of commands.When the maintenance panel of an 1108 indicates a Lisp-induced halt,pressing the UNDO key starts the TeleRaid server.  TeleRaid changes thecursor to the TeleRaid cursor, takes over the ethernet controller andkeyboard, then waits for commands from either the Ether or the keyboard.Keyboard commands are given by holding down the control key (or PROPS onthe standard Dandelion keyboard) and striking another key.  As youstrike a key, the cursor changes to give feedback about the command youare about to execute; the command is executed when you let go of thekey, but if you let go of the command key first, the command is aborted.The commands are as follows:    &uarr;N - like Raid &uarr;N: continue the computation.    &uarr;D - like Raid &uarr;D: do a HARDRESET.    &uarr;B - cause a break underneath the error.    &uarr;P - display the machine's Pup host number (decimal) in themaintenance panel	       (for remote debugging).TeleRaid refuses to execute the "&uarr;B" command if the user is executing ina place (e.g., inside of a garbage collection) that would be dangerousto allow a user break.You can put  an 1100 or 1132 (Dorado or Dolphin) into TeleRaid servermode by giving the "R" command to Raid and thus remotely debug it ormake use of TeleRaid's &uarr;B command (nothing corresponding to this commandis available in standard RAID).</pre>
