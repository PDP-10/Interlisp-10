I think particularly of the difficulty our Computing Centre has hadin getting detailed technical information on the 9700, for implementingTeX. Xerox tends to want non-disclosure agreements signed even before admitting the existence of documentation. I also remember an incident about 10 years ago when a lawyer at PARCdecided that BCPL was a Xerox proprietary product.In any case, I'm delighted that Xerox has released InterPress, and wouldappreciate a posting indicating where Canadian customers can order a copy.I will pass that information on to our Computing Centre people.I'm also looking forward to seeing Brian's comparison of the two languages.%Can't open "&lt;BBOARD&gt;LASER-LOVERS.TXT.1" for write - Write access requiredMM&gt;head CURRENT       95) 12-Feb Vincent Manis   Re: PostScript and Interpress (1751 chars)MM&gt;head 80:89 U    80)  6-Feb Brian Reid      PostScript and Interpress (2678 chars) U    81)  6-Feb Brian Reid      PostScript and Interpress (2678 chars) U    82)  7-Feb (Bill Johnston  Re: laser printers, 8 bit output  (3589 chars) U    83)  7-Feb cornell!decvax!

Now that he takes moneyfrom Adobe he seems to have found an opportunity to square the grievancehowever real or imagened it may be.The work of which he speaks, 'Introduction to Interpress', is public andis available as a part of the well publicized package which Xerox sellsfor $250.  The technical writing is excellent.  Brian's name appears onthe inside cover below that of Robert F. Sproull, reflecting traditionalacademic relationships.No need to proselytize for Xerox here.  Nor any need to take theconclusions of someone who is on the payroll of either outfit.  Thepublic nature of the work, the general availability from both Xerox andAdobe make it possible for all who choose to do so, to form their ownopinions about the relationship of these two printing languages.Brian's fine wordsmithing in the Introduction will make your job easier.It also makes clear that anyone who wishes may buy the material anddiscuss its contents.  Even Brian Reid.Can anyone seriously believe that, having made the information public,Xerox would have a significant interest in muzzling Prof. Reid inparticular?
