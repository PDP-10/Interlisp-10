SAMEDIRThis package advises MAKEFILE so that you can't inadvertently writeout a file onto a directory other than the one it came from (or atleast might have come from).  If you do a MAKEFILE and you areconnected to a directory other than one which occurs in one of thenames on the FILEDATES property of the file, and the file has aFILEDATES property at all (i.e. this isn't a brand new file),the system will prompt you:You are connected to &lt;ZENO&gt; where there is no TORTOISE -- should I write it out anyway ?Your options are Y (do the MAKEFILE), N (do an ERROR!), or E(go into a lower Exec so you can do a CONNECT, and try again).Default to the ASKUSER is Y (do the MAKEFILE).(C response possible to askuser; MIGRATIONS is ALIST of(olddir . newdir) of allowable movements).</pre>
