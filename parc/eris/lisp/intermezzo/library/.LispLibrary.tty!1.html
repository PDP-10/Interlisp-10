			LISP LIBRARY PACKAGES SUMMARY     The original source for this file is{ERIS}&lt;LISPCORE&gt;LIBRARY&gt;LISPLIBRARY.TTY.     This file is a summary of all files on &lt;LISP&gt;LIBRARY&gt;, and is agood document to read if you are unfamiliar with the many LIBRARYpackages available to you.  The paragraphs below summarize eachLIBRARY package or auxiliary file in 6 lines or less.     A similar library, &lt;LISPUSERS&gt;, contains contributions frommembers of the lisp community and is documented by&lt;LISPUSERS&gt;LISPUSERS.TTY.  Individuals are encouraged to contribute to&lt;LISPUSERS&gt;.			LISP LIBRARY PACKAGES SUMMARYAPS	Used by PCALLSTATS.BIG	Function NEWFONT sets up default fonts to be "size", wheresize is one of the atoms BIG, MEDIUM, STANDARD, SMALL.  Changes theprettyprint fonts, the default font for the break window, tyipin, etc.Does this by resetting FONTPROFILE and then setting the fonts for allof the known windows.BITMAPFNS	Miscellaneous functions for manipulating BITMAPs.Reading and writing bitmaps, reading certain press files, creatingwindow with image of bitmap.BROWSER Mastersope's SHOW PATHS output is displayed as a directedgraph showing calling hiarchy from a function.  Buttoning a node ofthe graph allows user to print, edit, or DESCRIBE the function.BSEARCH	??CHECKSET	Package checks source files against compiled filed ina directory and prompts user to (RE)COMPILE the files which need it.Compares FILECREATED expressions and determines whether a BRECOMPILEwith CHANGES will suffice or if it is necessary to BCOMPL the file.CIRCLPRINT		Prints circular structures.  Described in InterlispReference Manual.CLISPENG	Clispify into English.  Described in InterlispReference Manual.CMLARRAY Implements the functionality of arrays in the Common Lispdialect of Lisp; in particular, permits multi-dimensional arrays,"shared" arrays, and super-fast "open-coded" accessing.  See completedocumentation in the file CMLARRAY.TTYCMLSPECIALFORMS Provides Interlisp versions of some Common Lispprimitives (essentially MacLisp/Franz compatible).  CATCH and THROW,LET and LET*, LIST*, and DEFUN (but &amp;optional and &amp;rest not yetimplemented 10/10/83).COLOR		Support for color displays attached to Dorados or Dolphins.Color bitmaps, red-green-blue triples.  Supports BITBLT and DRAW fnsin color as well as other screen operations.COLORDEMO	Demos COLOR package.COLORPOLYGONS	Demos COLOR package.COMPILEBANG	Interface to the compiler that avoids the interviewfor the common cases of in-core compilation.  Call: (COMPILE! X NOSAVENOREDEFINE PRINTLAP).  Also adds LISPXMACRO and editmacro C.COMPMODEREC	Enables COMPILEMODE-dependent record declarations tobe declared so that access and layout for fields of a given record maybe specified in a single declaration for different targetimplementations (e.g. D vs PDP-10).COPYFILES	Functions for copying sets of files from one directory toanotherCOREHAX	Two core hacks.  Function PRINTVMEM prints out informationabout what pages are swapped in.  Function INCOREP tests if a compiledfunction is swapped in.  (Example: (MAPATOMS '(LAMBDA (X) (AND(INCOREP X) (PRINT X)))).)DATABASEFNS	Functions dealing with Masterscope database files.Described in Interlisp Reference Manual.DECL	Extends Interlisp to allow user to declare the types ofvariables and expressions appearing in functions.  Described inInterlisp Reference Manual.DLIONFS	Dandelion file server.  Implements file device access toDandelion local disk.DSPVTS Provides support Virtual Terminal Service using Interlisp-D'sDisplaystreams.  [VTS is a textline oriented set of commands such asmove forward one character position, move backward, move up one line,move down, insert/delete character, insert/delete line, etc.]EVALHOOK	Extends Interlisp and makes it easy to step or trace theinterpreter.EVALSERVER	Communication, over the EtherNet, between two or moreD-machines running Interlisp-D.  REMOTEVAL is the primary clientinterface; similar to EVAL, but done on another machine via Ethernetcommunications.FILEBANGER	Tests file devices by transferring files to and fromfile device and comparing.FILEBROWSER	Edit, Delete, Load, Compile, Copy, Rename, See,Hardcopy, &amp; Info on files on any file device through a common graphicinterface.  Call: (FILEBROWSER FILEPATTERN).FTPSERVER	Lisp implementation of PUP FTP (File TransferProtocol) server. Lets others FTP from you while you're running lisp.GATEWAY	 Make Dolphin with 3MB and 10MB Ethernet into a gateway,routing PUP and NS packets between them. Also runs a PUP name lookupserver.GCHAX		Garbage collection hacks.  Some useful functions for probing"storage leaks" (i.e. sources of garbage using up user's memory).Call: (\SHOWGC FILE TYPES CARLVL CDRLVL).GRAPEVINE	Implementation of PUP Grapevine protocols. Used byLafite, Maintain.HANOI		Displays and solves famous Towers of Hanoi problem.  Can runas a background process.  HANOIWINDOW can be reshaped.  Call: (HANOINRINGS WINDOW FONT ONCE).HASH	Hash file package described in Interlisp manual.HLCOLOR	 Used by COLORICONW		Package of functions for building icon windows with arbitraryshapes that can be used for shrinking windows. Prebuilt icon windowsstored in &lt;LISPUSERS&gt;STOCKICONS.KINETIC	Graphics demo.  Fast random BITBLTs on a window.  Call:(KINETICDEMO).LAFITE	Interlisp mail program, a la Laurel/Hardy.LAMBDATRAN		Facilitates defining new lambda words (e.g. LAMBDA,NLAMBDA) in such a way that a variety of other system packages willrespond to them appropriately.  Described in Interlisp ReferenceManual.LLCOLOR	Used by COLOR.LOADDM	Loads "dump" files as generated by Alto Executive/FTP.LOGOCLOCK	Analog clock inside Interlisp LOGO window.MAILCLIENT		Used by LAFITE.MAINTAIN	Lisp implementation of Grapevine MAINTAIN program foradding or deleting names from mail distribution lists.MAKEDSKSAVER	Creates two .cm files which FTP files from the localdisk to some other place, or vice versa.  Used when saving andrestoring file across a disk erasure.MENUEDWINDOW	Makes it easy to manipulate a window and an associatedmenu as a unit.  Contains heuristics that constrain size and shape ofwindow and menu.MTP	Used by LAFITE to read mail files on "MTP" servers. Only onein Xerox now is Maxc, maybe some older IFSes.PCALLSTATS		(Doesn't work on DLion) implements DOSTATS, which dumpsstatistics for every function call, and prints an exact timing summary.Uses APS.POLYGONS	Graphics demo: Changing polygons on the screen. Call(POLYGONS).PQUOTE	Package causes (QUOTE expression) to print out as 'expression,i.e., with single quote, both to file and to terminal.  Also moves Treadmacro to FILERDTBL so that such expressions will read in as (QUOTEexpression).PRINTER	package to do hardcopy of bitmaps and listfiles with multiplefonts for C.ITOH (Cheap!!!) printer connected to Dolphin parallelport.PUPIDSERVER	Tell other Dandelions on 10MB what their pup number is(good for running Mesa before machine is registered in the database.)READAIS	Read, write, transform AIS (color/grey scale) files.READNUMBER	Input a number from digits on the number-pad of somekeyboards.RDSYS		Used by READSYS.READSYS	Facilities for looking at sysout files and machines across thenetwork. Contains function TELERAID(host). If "host" is in TeleRaidstate (either via the R command to Raid on Dolphins or Dorados, or viahitting the "Undo" key on Dandelions from micro-breakpoint), can lookat its state using RAID-like commands. Can debug anywhere across theinternet (e.g., LispSupport.PA can debug YOUR machine.) The "server"end of this is built into every sysout.REMOTEVMEM	Used by READSYS.RS232	Basic software drivers for serving the RS232 serial interface.RS232CHAT	CHAT-like service through the RS232 portRS232EXEC	Inbound server for RS232 dialups; limited "executive"level service.RS232FTP	File transfer through the RS232 port; the protocolused is MODEM, which is currently supported for TOPS-20, UNIX, VMS,and a variety of personal computers.RS232LOGIN	Used by RS232CHAT and RS232FTP for "automated" loginto hosts connected throught the RS232 port.SAMEDIR	Advises MAKEFILE so that user can't inadvertently write out afile onto a directory other than the one it came from.  ChecksFILEDATES property against connected directory.SINGLEFILEINDEX	Package for giving user an alphabetical function indexon the front of any lisp file listed thru lisp.  Index number for afunction indicates function's linear occurence within file.  Withinthe lisp source, each function is preceded by it's index number rightjustified on the page.  Simpler but quicker than MULTIFILEINDEX.TEDIT		The Interlisp-D text editor.  Uses TEXTOFD.  Programmable.TEDITFIND	Used by TEDIT.TEDITHCPY	Used by TEDIT.TEXTOFD	Used by TEDIT.UPCSTATS	Microcode-PC Sample on Dorado. call (UPCSTATS 'form).When it asks for a ".MB" file, use {PHYLUM}&lt;Lisp&gt;Current&gt;D1Lisp.MB(symbol table for DoradoLispMC.eb). Output to display.UTILPROC	Simple utility processes, including hall-of-mirrorsdemo.VMEM	Used by READSYS.WINK	Movie of Marilyn Monroe winking.  Call: (SHOWMOVIE).  NeedsBITMAPFNS.</pre>
