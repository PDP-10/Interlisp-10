Intermezzo System Testing===== 32MB Vmem, storage managementTested:(1)  Tested that system works successfully with >8MB vmem and >32K atoms on all machines (Dorado, Dlion w/ CP4 upgrade, DTiger)(2)  Tested that lisp will NOT write beyond end of vmem file on Dlion, DTiger(3)  Ran block allocating program VMEMBANG for extended periods of time on all machines.  Discovered an important error (AR 3186) that had been fixed in the lispcore sysout but not in Intermezzo.  No other unexpected errors occurred.(4)  Tested making/loading sysouts between all configurations of machines (Dorado, Dlion w/ CP4, DTiger), seperately testing sysouts with "small" vmem (<8MB vmem, <32K atoms) and "big" vmem (>8MB, >32K atoms).(5)  Tried testing VMEM.PURE.STATE.  Ran into problems (see AR 3430 below).  This is not important to fix for Intermezzo, since this is an undocumented feature.Not Tested:Known Bugs:AR 3429: If sysout fails, \VMEM.INHIBIT.WRITE is still set to TAR 3430: Intermittent problems with VMEM.PURE.STATE; MP 9024 and very slow performance===== Fonts:Tested:(1)  Did FONTCREATE to read all Display, Press, and Interpress font files on {eris}<lisp>fonts>.  No problems, except as described below.  (2)  Checked that all types of font files (AC display, STRIKE display, Interpress WD, Press FONTS.WIDTHS) can be read from all file devices:Local 1108 DSK{CORE} device{FLOPPY}NS file serverVAX running UNIXNot Tested:(1)  Didn't print out and examine every single font on {eris}<lisp>fonts>, although spot checks indicated that any problems were due to too many fonts on a page, or font not available on the printer.(2)  Didn't test using VAX/VMS as font file server, because of file name length restriction.Known Bugs:AR 3342: (FONTSAVAILABLE '* '* '* '* 'INTERPRESS T) breaks with message "ARG not list"Display font problems:In TimesRoman72D fonts (BRR, MRR), the space character shows as a vertical line.CLASSICTHIN display fonts only have left and right parens, squiggle brackets, and brackets.The file SNAIL10b-C0.DISPLAYFONT -- don't know what it is.  File name not in correct format for normal font-file-reading programs.  Probably an alternate version of SNAIL10-C0.DISPLAYFONT.Interpress font problems:LOGO fonts do not have char set 357.  (Doesn't matter, since only the letters XERO are included in the font.Press font problems:Following fonts show up in FONTSAVAILABLE, but break when trying to do FONTCREATE:XHELV 9 MRR			-> FONT NOT FOUND TRIANGLES 14 MRR		-> ILLEGAL ARG -6DCW 18 MRR			-> ILLEGAL ARG -39KEYHOLE * BRR		-> ILLEGAL ARG -675FRUTIGERPIONE * BIR	-> ILLEGAL ARG -504All ILLEGAL ARG errors are under \PUTBASE.UFN under \CREATEPRESSFONTA0001.=====  1108 Local File SystemTested:(1)  Tested all documented user functions: VOLUMES, DISKFREEPAGES, etc.(2)  Ran DSKTEST for extended periods on different configurations of machines/disks (DLion, DTiger; 10MB disk, 43MB disk, 80MB disk; one local file volume, multiple local file volumes).(3)  Tested that local file system info was updated appropriately when transferring sysout from machine with local file system directory to machine without.  Tested all combinations  (from localdir to no localdir, from no localdir to localdir).  Tested transferring sysout between Dorado and 1108 with local file system.(4) Tested putting local file system directory on clean volume, on lisp sysout volume, on mesa volume.(5)  Tested making sysout to local file system volume.(6) Tested SCAVENGEDSKDIRECTORY(7)  Filled up the local file system directory with thousands of small files.(8)  Filled up the local file system directory with one big file.(9)  Tested that SCAVENGEDSKDIRECTORY reduces size of big directory, causing directory operations (INFILEP, etc.) to go much faster.Not Tested:Try putting local file directory on Copilot volume.Put open DSKDISPLAY window on Dlion, make sysout, and load on Dorado.  DSKDISPLAY should disappear (see AR 3456)Known Bugs:===== File Servers and CommunicationsTested:NS, PUP, DEI, Unix FILING:	DIR, CONN,  DELFILE, RENAMEFILE, SEE	COPYFILE TO: NS->IFS; IFS->NS; IFS->VMS; IFS->UNIX 			VMS->IFS; UNIX->IFS	copied entire sysout  to NS server from 10MB dlion	LOAD, MAKEFILE 	TCOMPL: dwimify.dcom, edit.dcom (at least 2 generations)	INFILE, OPENFILE, OPENP, CLOSEF, CLOSEALL 	NSCREATEDIRECTORY	GETFILEINFO: size, access, file.type, type 			SETFILEINFO: access, type, file.type 	GETFILEPTR, FULLNAME	FILEBROWSER: see, edit, hardcopy, delete, undelete, copy, 			renameKnown Bugs:	NS: AR 3372	SETFILEINFO returns nil instead of filename when trying to set  ACCESS field to APPEND or BOTH, for  IFS , NS file servers AS WELL AS {DSK} AND {CORE}.	DEI: AR 3336 GETFILEINFO  'ACCESS returns incorrect info  unless version number is included in file spec	UNIX: AR 3374 OPENFILE reports FILE WON'T OPEN when ACCESS mode is set to APPEND or BOTH===== Press, Interpress PrintingTested:To all printers, tested:	PRINTERTYPE, PRINTFILETYPE	NSPRINT, NSPRINTERSTATUS	EFTP, PRINTERSTATUS	SEND.FILE.TO.PRINTER	HARDCOPYW 		NSPRINTER.PROPERTIES	OPENIMAGESTREAM: DISPLAY, PRESS, INTERPRESS; {LPT}, file	DRAWCIRCLE, DRAWCURVE Known Bugs:Some graphics operations (DRAWCURVE, etc) do not print correctly on "Full Press" printers, such as Raven Printers.===== CHATTested:Chat (IFS, NS, DEI, UNIX)	(CHAT):		LOGIN, ATTACH, GUEST	background menu:		INPUT, CLOSE, RECONNECT, SUSPEND, FREEZE, 		EMACS, DRIBBLE, NEW		reshape the chat window		maitain multiple chat connections to same host, 		different hostsKnown Bugs:		AR 3382 middle buttoning CLEAR while CHAT ing to IFS and NS servers  breaks  with UNDEF CAR CHAT.CLEAR		AR 2283 Middle buttoning NEW while  CHAT ing to IFS or NS file server puts input cursor in top level window but HOST: prompt  in prompt window 		AR 3384 Middle buttoning FREEZE while CHAT ing to IFS Eris can  only be unfroze with another middle button keypress		===== FLOPPYTested:(Dlion)Copy Intermezzo sysout from {FLOPPY} to server		IFS server - {PHYLUM}, NS server - {PHYLEX:}, Vax server - {PARC-CSLI}SYSOUT[{FLOPPY}] & FLOPPY.MODE(SYSOUT)		2nd, 3rd, 4th Generation sysoutsLarge Tcompl on floppy		1.
