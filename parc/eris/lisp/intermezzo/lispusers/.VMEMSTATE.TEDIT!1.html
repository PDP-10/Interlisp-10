VMEMSTATEBy R. M. KaplanFebrary 15, 1985This package is used to switch back and forth between a "public" and a "private" virtual memory, using VMEM.PURE.STATE.  If your VMEM is public, then dirty pages will not overwrite the pages as they were originally installed on your disk, SAVEVM is disabled, and LOGOUT is always in Fast mode.  In other words, if you ever leave your system, the machine will be back in the state it was in when you started.  A private VMEM behaves in the ordinary way--dirty pages overwrite their orginal versions, and SAVEVM and LOGOUT (slow mode) will always check point your current state.(VMEMSTATE mode)  sets the mode of the current VMEM to mode, either PUBLIC, PRIVATE, or NIL (no action is taken).  Returns the previous setting.</pre>
