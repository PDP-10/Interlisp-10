Basic Operations</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br><br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">COMPONENTS</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>The Xerox 1108 is a compact, personal Interlisp-D workstation consisting of a processor, display, keyboard, mouse, floppy disk drive, and a rigid disk drive.  <br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">The Display</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>The display is a large format CRT (17" diagonal)  with a  high resolution bitmap  (1024 x 808 pixels).   Intensity is controlled by a lever under the left side of the screen.  The display may be tilted back and forth to maximize comfort and minimize glare.<br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">The Keyboard</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>The keyboard consists of  78 keys, 24 of which are function keys.  All 78 keys are unencoded.  The maximum distance between keyboard and processor is approximately 8 feet.  <br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">The Mouse</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>The mouse is one of three types: 2-button mechanical, 3-button mechanical, or 3-button optical. The middle key of the 2-button mouse is the CENTER key on the keyboard. If you have an optical mouse, use the specially designed grey, hexagon-patterned paper as a mouse pad.  The mouse is attached to the keyboard with approximately 2 l/2 feet of thin cable. <br>  <br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">The Processor</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>The processor houses a floppy disk drive, a 10 or 43 Megabyte rigid disk, and six printed circuit boards: the IO processor, Central processor, High Speed IO processor, Memory Storage, Memory Control, and the Options board.  A serial port (RS232) is located in the rear of the processor. If the 29 Megabyte rigid disk is used, it is housed in a separate box.<br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">The Rigid Disk<br></span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br>The rigid disk has  10, 29, or 42 Megabytes capacity.  Depending on size, it is divided into two or more </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">logical volumes</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">.  Each logical volume has a name and length.    Instructions are provided for loading each volume with the appropriate software. <br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">The Floppy Disk Drive<br><br></span><span style="font: 10pt serif">The floppy disk drive is located on the front of the processor.  <br><br>To load a floppy disk:<br><br>1.  Locate the floppy disk drive on your processor.  If the door is not open, press the long, narrow bar (with the circle in the center) immediately below the drive.<br><br>2.  Floppy disks normally are labeled to indicate which side should go in and which side should be facing up.<br><br>3.  When the disk is fully into the drive, you will hear a click.  When you release the disk, it will pop out if it was not fully into the drive.  <br><br>4.  Press down on the door firmly to close it.<br><br>To Unload a floppy disk:<br><br>1.  Make sure the red read/write light (circle in the center of the drive door bar) is not illuminated.<br><br>2.  Press the drive door bar.<br><br>3.  Remove the disk and store it in its jacket.<br><br>When storing floppy disks, keep them  away from magnets, dust, and heat.  Do not bend them.  Do not write on their labels with ball-point pens or pencils of any sort.  Any of these actions could damage the disk and prevent successful use of it.</span></div>

<span style="font: bold 10pt serif"><br></span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">Service considerations<br><br></span><span style="font: 10pt serif">To make sure the Xerox technical representative has enough room to access the display screen, position the display  so that there is a total of 14 inches minimum on the sides.    The Processor should be positioned to provide access to the front panel of the unit.  You will need access to the front panel to load floppy disks and to turn the processor on and off, or boot the system.  Make sure there is sufficient air movement around the processor, so it is not damaged by the heat it produces.  The back of the processor must be at least 6 inches from the wall.   If possible, provide enough space around the processor for servicing by the Xerox technical representative.  An area 4 feet long by six feet wide, or an area that size in front of the processor so that it can be pulled out, is sufficient for servicing.   The processor should be positioned in a permanent location.  Bumping and jarring it hard enough, even when turned off, can destroy the magnetic heads or the media.  If you must move the processor, take care not to suddently jolt or bump it.</span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif"><br><br>RS232</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>Two serial ports are available: a standard RS232 port and a TTY port, labeled </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">Printer/DTB</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">.  Xerox supplies a standard cabel for the former; special cabling is required by the latter, depending on the particular application.  For a complete description of RS232 software support, please consult documentation for the RS232 Lisp Library package. <br><br><br>OPERATIONS<br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">Turning on the Processor</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br></span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">Note:  Wait at least three minutes if you decide to turn the processor on after turning it off.</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>1.  Pull down on the cover of the Maintenance Panel if the cover is closed.<br><br>2.  Before turning the system on, simultaneously press both the </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">B RESET</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> and </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">ALT B</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> buttons on the front panel and push the rocker switch to the 1 position.   The maintenance panel will display the numbers 8888.  Release the </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">B RESET</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">  and  </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">ALT B</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> key.<br><br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">Booting the Processor<br></span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br>The software delivered with your Xerox 1108 is bound into a runnable package called a </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">boot file</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">.  The process of loading a boot file into the 1108 is called </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">booting</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">. Boot files may be booted from either the rigid disk or a floppy disk.  Normally, the rigid disk is set up so that powering up the processor resumes the last Interlisp-D session. If the rigid disk has not been properly initialized, the only alternative is to boot from a Xerox-supplied bootable floppy.<br><br>Two types of booting are available on the Xerox 1108: normal booting and alternate booting.  Normal booting assumes that Interlisp-D has been properly set up in a logical volume of the rigid disk.  Alternate booting allows for booting of utility software from the rigid disk or a floppy disk.<br><br>If Interlisp-D is properly installed, a normal boot is performed by pressing and releasing the </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">B RESET</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> (left) boot button.  The maintenance panel will go blank and then display 8888 for a few seconds.  A succession of maintenance panel codes will then be displayed during the booting sequence.  The booting process completes with 0000 in the maintenance panel.  Interlisp-D should be ready within about 10 seconds.  If you ended a previous Interlisp-D session by logging out, a normal boot will resume that session.  If you are running Interlisp-D for the first time, the most recently installed logical volume will be booted.<br><br>To perform an alternate boot, press both </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">B RESET</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> and </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">ALT B</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> buttons, then let go of </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">B RESET</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">.  The maintenance panel will go blank, show 8888, then cycle slowly and repeatedly through the sequence 0000, 0001, ..., 0010.  Release the </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">ALT B</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> button when the desired number is showing.  The options are:<br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0000</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">  Boot Interlisp-D from a logical volume on the rigid disk.  Usually, the logical volume selected will be the one containing the most recently used Interlisp-D system; i.e., if you terminate an Interlisp-D session with LOGOUT, then 0-boot will resume that session from where you left off.  However, if the most recent activity was installing a fresh Interlisp-D system on a logical volume, 0-boot will boot from that logical volume.  (Note, to boot Interlisp-D from any logical volume, use the </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">Install Lisp Tool.</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">)  <br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0001</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">  Boot the 1108 into its </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">base state</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">.  From this state it is possible to start utility programs such as diagnostics, or a tool to install and start Interlisp-D on different logical volumes.<br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0002</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">  Floppy boot (suppress diagnostics).  Only specially configured Xerox floppies, such the </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">Installation Utility</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">, or </span><span style="font: italic 10pt serif">EI Fixed Disk Diagnostics</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">, may be booted this way.  <br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0005</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">  Floppy boot (with diagnostics).  This is identical to a 2-boot, except that machine diagnostics are run  automatically before the floppy is booted.  <br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0010</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">  Floppy disk drive head cleaning function  (see below.)<br><br><br></span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">Turning off the Processor</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"><br><br>1.  Make sure you are logged off and see the bouncing white square on your display.<br><br>2.  Before you turn the system OFF, press both the </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">B RESET</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> and </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">ALT B</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> buttons on the workstation front panel and push the rocker switch to the 0 position.

<span style="font: 10pt serif"><br>3.  Turn the head cleaning disk over and dispense about l/2 teaspoon of the disk cleaning solution over the large cutout area.<br><br>4.  Insert the head cleaning disk into the floppy disk drive with the perforated tab facing upward.<br><br>5.  Do a 10-boot.<br><br>6.  When the maintenance panel displays </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0076</span><span style="font: 10pt serif">, press the </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">ALT B</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> button.  </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0077</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> will be displayed for about 15 seconds while the drive is being cleaned, then </span><span style="font: bold 10pt serif">0076</span><span style="font: 10pt serif"> will be displayed once again. <br><br>7.
