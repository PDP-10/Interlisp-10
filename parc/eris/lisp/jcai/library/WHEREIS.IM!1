In this case, {fn WHEREIS} will consult, in addition to the files on {var FILELST}, the hashfiles that are on the value of {index WHEREIS.HASH Var}{var WHEREIS.HASH}.  [note: normally the user will just enter the fullname of a file onto {var WHEREIS.HASH}, but as the {fn WHEREIS} begins to use it, it will convert the entry into a cons of the name and the hash file handle.]Many system functions, such as the editors, call {fn WHEREIS} with {arg FILES}={lisp T}, so loading this package automatically makes any information contained in the {fn WHEREIS} database files available throughout the system.Information may be added to an existing WHEREIS hashfile, or by creating new databases.  It is often useful to have a separate database for large user systems.  explicitly calling the following function:{FnDef {FnName WHEREISNOTICE} {FnArgs FILEGROUP NEWFLG DATABASEFILE}{TextInserts the information about all of the functions on the files in {arg FILEGROUP} into the {fn WHEREIS} data base contained on {arg DATABASEFILE}.  If {arg DATABASEFILE} is {lisp NIL}, the first entry on {var WHEREIS.HASH} is used.{arg FILEGROUP} may be simply a list of files, in which case each file thereon is handled directly; but it may also be a pattern to be given as a filegroup argument to {fn DIRECTORY} ({PageRef Fn DIRECTORY}), so {lisp &}, {lisp $}, etc. may be used.    If {arg NEWFLG} is non-{lisp NIL}, a new version of {arg DATABASEFILE} will be created containing the database for the functions specified in {arg FILEGROUP}.  If {arg NEWFLG} is a number, the hash file will be created with {arg NEWFLG} entries.  Otherwise, it will be created to allow 20000 entries.Example:The following sequence of actions will cause all of the files on the PROJECT directory to be noticed by the WHEREIS package.(WHEREISNOTICE '<PROJECT>*. T '<PROJECT>PROJECTWHEREIS.HASH)(push WHEREIS.HASH (FINDFILE '<PROJECT>PROJECTWHEREIS.HASH))}}}{End SubSec WHEREIS Package}
