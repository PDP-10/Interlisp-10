SAMEDIRThe SAMEDIR package modifies MAKEFILE to against inadvertently writingout a file onto a directory other than the one it came from.  If you do a MAKEFILE and you are connected to a directory other than one which occurs in one of the names on the FILEDATES property of the file, and the file has a FILEDATES property at all (i.e. this isn't a brand new file), the system will prompt you:You haven't loaded or written TORTOISE in your connected directory {DSK}&lt;LISPFILES&gt; -- should I write it out anyway ?Your options are one of the letters Y, N, C or O:Yes					do the MAKEFILENo					abort the MAKEFILEConnect to other directory:	 allows you to type in another directory pathOops! Connect to directory      Connect to the "best guess". This option requires confirmation, in case you don't like what the system prompts you.Default to the ASKUSER is Y (do the MAKEFILE).Parameters:MIGRATIONS					[variable]For those who regularly LOADFROM files on one directory and  MAKEFILE elsewhere, there is the variable MIGRATIONS is ALIST of (olddir . newdir) which specifies which migrations are "allowable". For example, if it is legitimate to LOADFROM a file on {MYHOST}&lt;STANDARDRELEASE&gt; and then do a MAKEFILE to {MYHOST}&lt;INPROGRESS&gt; then adding ({MYHOST}&lt;STANDARDRELEASE&gt; . {MYHOST}&lt;INPROGRESS&gt;) to MIGRATIONS will prevent MAKEFILE from complaining about such movement.ImplementationSAMEDIR adds the form (CHECKSAMEDIR) to MAKEFILEFORMS. It compares the (HOST&amp;DIRECTORYFIELD oldfile) against (DIRECTORYNAME T T) to see whether the connected directory matches the old files source.Known problemsFor Unix hosts using PUP FTP protocol, there is sometimes an inconsistancy between the directory name in the "full file name" and the directory name in DIRECTORYNAME. SAMEDIR may have troubles in that case detecting that the directories are the same.</pre>
