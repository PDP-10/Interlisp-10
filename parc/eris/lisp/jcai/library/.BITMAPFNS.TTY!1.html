This file has a number of miscelaneous functions for manipulating BITMAPS.(READBINARYBITMAP width height file)reads a series of bytes from FILE and creates a width x height bitmap with contents. Note that each scanline of the bitmap is rounded up to nearest multiple of 16 bits (2 bytes).(WRITEBINARYBITMAP bitmap file)writes out BITMAP to FILE in format read by READBINARYBITMAP. Please note that READBINARYBITMAP must be supplied with width and height.(WRITEBM FILE BITMAP)writes BITMAP on FILE first preceeding with width and height (in binary) suchthat it can be read in with READBM.(READBM FILE)	reads width, height, and then appropriate size bitmap(WRITEBMLST FILE LST)	writes a list of bitmaps on FILE(READBMLST FILE)	reads a list of bitmaps	These functions open &amp; close FILE(READPRESS pressfile)	reads press file PRESSFILE and returns a bitmap. Can only	handle press files generated by PRESSBITMAP and a couple	of other utilities. Has no smarts, and is not easily extended.(WINDOWBM bitmap position)	creates and returns a window containing image of bitmap. Will	be at POSITION or (GETPOSITION).</pre>
