Some software must be pre-loaded onto your 1108 system before you can use it.  <br><br>PRE-LOADING WITH DIAGNOSTICS FILES.<br><br>The following floppies are required: (1) The Installation Utility; (2) Diagnostics File.<br></span></div>
<span style="font: 10pt serif">1.  Load the Installation Utility in the floppy drive and do a 2-boot.  (A 2-boot is done by press both the B RESET and ALT B buttons on the front panel and release the B RESET button immediately.  Release the ALT B button when the font panel reads 0002.)  After about two minutes a list of utility options will be displayed.<br><br>2.  Select menu item "Install Diagnostics".<br><br>3.  Unload the floppy drive and load the "Diagnostics File" floppy.<br><br>4.  Respond to the prompt on the display with Y.<br><br>5.  When the Installation menu reappears, perform a 1-boot.<br><br>6.  In about 2 minutes, the Tajo environment will be running.  Activate the Exec window in the bottom left hand corner.  The screen will be configured to accept typein.  Press any mouse button to activate the input cursor.  You are now ready to begin typing.<br><br>7.  Unload the floppy drive and insert the Installation Utility floppy.<br><br>8.  Type in  "floppy read InstallLispTool.bcd ".  You should be able to hear the floppy drive, as the file InstallLispTool.bcd is transferred from the floppy disk to the rigid disk.  <br><br>9.  Type InstallLispTool &lt;CR&gt; at your exec window.<br><br>10.  Do a 1-boot.  This should get you to the bouncing square on your display.<br><br><br><br>B.	LOADING INTERLISP-D SOFTWARE.<br><br>There are two ways to load your Interlisp-D software.  The first way is to load from floppy disketts that are distributted to you the second way is to load  from your file server.<br><br>Loading Interlisp-D from your floppies:<br><br>1.	Place the "Installation Utility" disk in you floppy disk drive and do a 2-boot.<br><br>2.	When the Installation menu comes up, select the item labelled "Install Interlisp on Lisp/x volume". Note for the 29MB and 43MB disks, you have three lisp volumes, the Lisp, Lisp2 and Lisp3. For the 10MB disk you only have Lisp volume.<br><br>3.	Follow through the dialog to load your Interlisp-D floppies.  For different Lisp sysout files you can have from three to five floppies.<br><br>4.	After Interlisp is loaded, you may select "Start Interlisp from Lisp/x volume" option or you may exit by doing a 1-boot.<br><br> <br>       <br>Loading Interlisp-D from your file server.<br><br>There is a window tool that allows one to install Interlisp-D software from NS or IFS file server.  If you have net acess to a file server you can use this tool.  <br><br>The tool is invoked when you have a DMT bouncing square on your CRT.  If you dont have the bouncing square, then make sure you have done the pre-loading software correctly.<br><br>To activate the tool, click the left button of your mouse.<br><br>The tool window is a rectangular region and is composed of 1) a herald name, 2) a message sub-window, 3) a parameter sub-window, 4) a command sub-window and 5)a file sub-window.<br><br>The top line is the herald name, and consists of a) the tool&rsquo;s name, b) the operating system&rsquo;s version which the tool was bounded and c) the tool&rsquo;s creation time.<br><br>The message sub-window is a two-line form window which displays the error messages if any.<br><br>The parameter sub-window is a form sub-window and contains the following paramters:<br><br>	Doc.:{General, ErroMsg}		File Server: {IFS, NS}<br>	File: [Server]&lt;Directory&gt;&lt;Subdirectories&gt;FileName.sysout<br>	Volume:				VMem Size = 0<br>	User:				Password:<br>	Domain:				Organization:<br><br>The command sub-window is a form sub-window and contains the following commands:<br><br>	Install File!	Start Volume!		Set VMem Size!	Floppy!		Help!<br>	Erase volume!	Scavenge Volume!	Remote Boot!	Quit!<br><br><br><br>The file sub-window displays the event messages relevant to that command.<br><br><br>PARAMETER ITEMS:<br><br>	Doc.:  The document parameter is an enumerated item which is used in conjunction with the Help command.  It selects which document is to be displayed on the file subwindow for a quick reference.  The &rsquo;General&rsquo; displays the general writeup of the tool, while the &rsquo;ErrorMsg&rsquo; displays the error message and its meaning on the file subwindow.<br>	<br>	File Server.:  An enumerated item which shows the selection of the File Server protocol type to be used for the Install File command.<br><br>	File:		specifies the the file pathname of Lisp sysout file to be retrieved from the file server.  The complete file pathname on an IFS looks like [Server]&lt;Directory&gt;SubDirectories&gt;FileName.Sysout.  An example will be [Rose]&lt;Lisp&gt;Fugue&gt;Lisp.sysout.<br><br>The complete file name on a NS file server looks like [Server:Domain:Organization]&lt;Directory&gt;SubDirectories&gt;FileName.Sysout.  An example will be [Phylex:XSIS North:Xerox]&lt;Demos&gt;Demo.sysout<br>An equivalent but shorter way will be [Phylex:]&lt;Demos&gt;Demo.sysout<br><br>Note: The server, domain and Organization name are restricted to Alphanumerics plus the following character "-, :, #, SP".  (SP: space character).  The first character needs to be a letter, else an error message of "scan error on Server:Domain:Organization" will be posted.<br><br><br>	Volume Menu:	is a "string menu" which gets displayed by chording (presing both mouse buttons for a 2-button mouse or the middle button for a 3-button mouse) the mouse buttons.  The menu contains the exact volume names as configured in that machine.  If Lisp volume is presnet in the machine, it gets seleceted else nothing gets selected as default.  To change the volume selection, simply move the mouse and select the volume desired in the menu. <br><br>	VMem Size:	shows the size of the Interlisp&rsquo;s virtual memory file in pages.<br><br>	User:		is your Pup/NS registered user name.<br><br>	Password:	is your associated password for login.<br><br>	Domain:		is your domain name as defined in your Clearinghouse database.<br><br>	Organization:	is your organization name as defined in your Clearinghouse database.<br><br>The tool fetches from user.cm file under [system] setction for the user, password, domain and organization fields.  If they are present, their values will be  displayed.<br><br><br>COMMAND ITEMS<br><br>	Install File!:	fetches the file name specified in the File parameter and installs it into the Lisp volume selected.  The file transfer can be aborted by depressing the STOP key.<br><br>	Start Volume!: 	boots the Lisp volume selected.<br><br>	Set VMem Size!: extends the vitual memory size to the size specified at "VMem Size data parameter".<br><br><br>	Floppy!:  	gives an additional window which contains the floppy related commands.<br>	Erase Volume!:	erases the contents of the volume. <br><br>	Scavenge Volume!: performs a file-scavenage on the volume selected.  <br>			Scavenge produces the MSScavenge.log file in that volume.<br>.<br><br>	Remote Boot!:	 performs a cross-volume copy of boot file from one logical volume to another logical volume and then boots up the destination volume.  <br>	Quit!:		returns the tool to the bouncing square state<br><br><br><br>C.	YOUR USER.CM FILE<br><br>	The tool parses your user.cm file for some default setting.  In specific, "User", "Password", "Domain", "Organization" "File Server" and "File" parameters will be set if present in the user.cm file.  Below is a sample user.cm, you should modify the appropriate fileds for your convenience.<br><br>[User.cm]<br>[System]<br>User: UserName<br>Password: YourPassword<br>Domain: DomainName<br>Organization: OrganizationName<br>FileServer: NS<br>NSFile: [Server:Domain:Organization]&lt;Directory&gt;SubDirectories&gt;FileName.Sysout<br>PUPFile: [Server]&lt;Directory&gt;SubDirectories&gt;FileName.Sysout<br>Screen: White<br>Debug: FALSE<br><br>[Diagnostics:System]<br>InitialCommand: InstallLispTool <br><br><br><br>D.	SOME DEFAULT SETTING<br><br>	File Server:  Your file server type is defaulted to be NS, unless  specified at user.cm<br>	<br>	The Virtual memory image size of your logical volume is defaulted to be 2000 pages less of your logical volume size.<br>	<br>	The volume parameter is defaulted to be "Lisp" if it is present in your physical volume else it is nil.<br>	<br><br><br>E.	PROFILE-TOOL<br><br>	The profile tool is designed for users to easily change default settings on the user.cm file.  It is very useful to set your desired file-path name, your user name, and domain, organization and not typing them in on the window.  You may enter your password in the profile-tool at your own judgement.  CAUTION:  do not use this tool, if you have your own user.cm file, it is intended to be used by sites that run Lisp applications only. <br>       	</span><script>function do_tabs() { // unit = px
