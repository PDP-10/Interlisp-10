Provides a graphics editor (also useful for single images) to create frames which are played back in real-time like a movie.  Versatile and easy to learn and use; several demo animations included on Lispusers.  LOAD (ACE), then call (ACE).ACTIVEREGIONS	Package for specifying that certain regions of a window be sensitive to button activity of the mouse.  Regions are highlighted when mouse button is down and associated function for an active region is invoked when mouse button is released.ANIMATE.  This small package contains functions for moving a non-rectangular bitmap smoothly around the screen, ways of using these to get big cursors, and bitmaps for a large arrow and a hand to be used as large cursors.ARCHIVETOOL  An Interlisp-D interafce to the PARC Cedar Archive system.  Based on the FileBrowser and Lafite.  It automatically composes and sends archive messages to the Archivist.  It also parses the returned messages and deletes the archived files.  Retrieve requests are not yet supported.AREDIT	Tool for submitting, viewing, & editing Lisp ARs (action requests/Interlisp bug reports) from within Interlisp.  Type (AR.FORM) to create a form for Getting, Putting, & Submitting ARs.ARITHMAC	Arithmetic macros for use with Interlisp-10 and the DECL package for a variety of arithmetic functions (ADD1, QUOTIENT, RAND, etc.). Not useful (except for backward compatibility) for Interlisp-D.AUXMENU  This package creates a middle button background menu containing a number of convenient functions. These functions include a menu-driven CNDIR, LOGOUT, and other functions that require little user-interaction. The purpose of the package is to minimize typeing. BACKGROUND    BITBLT to the screen background or to windows without TOTOPW-ing them.  Much faster than CHANGEBACKGROUND.  Supports all BITBLT options including MERGE but not 16x16 textures.BACKGROUNDDEMO    Demonstration and programming example for the BACKGROUND package.BIZGRAFIX	Pie & bar chart, line graph creation.BLTDEMO	Implements Smalltalk graphics demo in Interlisp.  Spinning star, bouncing ring & box.  Call: (BOUNCE x y) where x and y are velocities defaulting to 3.  Box shows whatever is near cursor. Interesting recursive effects can be seen if you move the cursor near the box. Idle hack.BOUNCE  Is another Idle hack.  Blacks out the screen & draws patterns on it until you hit a mouse button or type any character. Can be started 3 ways.BOUNDARY   A package for handling boundaries - which are similar to regions but much more efficient in certain applications.  An optional freelist can reduce garbage collection.BOYERMOORE    The Boyer and Moore Theorem Prover.BQUOTE	Backquote punctuation.  Enables backquote (character 96) and commas to be used to construct lists similar to CLISP's <, !, !!, and > operators only better.  Readmacros and prettyprintmacros make backquote easy to use.  Also offers PQUOTE's functionality.CALENDAR A calendar/appointment-reminder program.  Displays any year, month or day.  Messages alert you at predetermined time, or can optionally be mailed (via Lafite) to any desired recipients.  CALL: (CALENDAR).CHUNK-MENU	 Permits the creation and use of pop-up menus for long lists of items.  User sees one "chunk" of the list at a time.  Menu items at top and bottom allow user to move forward and backward to other chunks.COMHACK Advises CLISPIF and CLISPFOR to allow comments anywhere in ifs and for loops.  Can be used to provide similar facility for other CLISP words.CROCK 	Function for creating and manipulating a face clock. Menu allows user to change style of clock.  Call: (CROCK REGION).DEDITK Adds single button method for combining the most frequently combined pairs of BI/BO and BEFORE/AFTER/DELETE/REPLACE in DEDIT - Load and call (DEDITK).DPRESS	Disassemble PRESS.  Functions to disassemble PRESS files. Used by PRESSTOIP.DRAWFILE	Two functions for converting DRAW-format files (produced by Alto DRAW program) to and from lisp figure data-structures.  Supports spline curves, text, and color.EDITFONT	Gives the user functions for creating and editting DISPLAY fonts which can be read and written as STRIKE font files. Includes: EDITFONT, BLANKFONTCREATE, READSTRIKEFONTFILE, and WRITESTRIKEFONTFILE.EDITHIST	An extension to Interlisp's file package that permanently preserves the history of new versions of files.  Every time a file is remade, a new entry containing DATE, AUTHOR, FILE, CHANGES, & COMMENTS info is added.EMACS 	A subset of EMACS (text editor developed at MIT) built on top of TEDIT.  Call: (EMACS FILE).EMACSUSER	Package defines a variety of functions amenable to creating a programming environment where the user does his coding in EMACS (the MACLISP/EMACS style of coding versus the Interlisp file package style of coding).  EXEC	This small package allows the user to create extra EXEC windows in which to do EVALQTing.  A new EXEC window may be created in either of two ways.  The user may either do (EXEC) or button the EXEC menu item added to the background menu.EXECFNS Package emulates TOPS-20-style "logical names".  Instead of typeing {RED}<FOODIRECTORY> you can use the DEF lispxmacro to define FOO: as {RED}<FOODIRECTORY>.  Lispxmacros TY, CONN & KD and fns INFILE, OUTFILE, INFILEP, OUTFILEP, & COPYFILE are modified/advised to expand logical names.  The lispxmacro DEF? can be used to see what logical defs are currently defined.FACEINVADER	A game.  The object of the game is to shoot the bouncing 'face' before it overruns your base.  Call: (FI INSTRUCTIONS?).FASTLOAD	Function to load a file without file package overhead or changes to history list.  Otherwise like (LOAD FILE T)--old definitons are simply overwritten.  Call: (FASTLOAD FILE).FBSORT  Adds a SORT menu option to FileBrowsers.FONTN	 Contains font definitions for fonts FONT1, FONT2, etc., whichare utilized by the printout for commands of the form .FONT 1, .FONT2, etc.FRACTAL An eyewash DMT program that draws fractals.GLISP	 Compiler for GLISP, object oriented form of lisp.GRAPHCALLS 	Allows fast graphing of the calling hiarchy of bothinterpreted and compiled code, whether or not the source code isavailable, thus allowing examination of both user and system functions.HEADLINE	Three functions for manipulating windows containingheadlines: HEADLINE, BILLBOARD, and CLOSEHEADLINES.

CALL: (PACMAN).PAGEFULLCTRL	Useful for controlling the scrolling behaviour of theTTYDISPLAYSTREAM window.  PAGEFULLFN is advised to continue scrolling(rather than inverting the window and waiting for a space to be typed)unless the CTRL key is held down.PAGEHOLD	Redefines the default PAGEFULLFN, and provides hooks formaking individual non-TTYDISPLAYSTREAM windows scrollable.  Scrolling is "held" for up to PAGE.WAIT.SECS seconds, during which time anattached "button" on the window softly flashes, and then the hold is"released". Holding down either SHIFT key will continue the "hold"(i.e., prevent "release"); letting up on either SHIFT key will "release"the "hold".PATCHUP Facilitates making patch files when there is multiuserinteraction on a system.  Designed to allow dumping of a patch filecontaining changes from a number of files.PEANO	 Peano curves graphics demo.  CALL: (PEANODEMO LEVEL SCALE).PERFORMTRAN	Adds CLISP word perform to record package.  Rumored tobe described in Interlisp Reference Manual (GKW).PERMSTATUS	 Function used in conjunction with WHENCLOSE package tomake a file "permanently" open in the sense that as much of its statusas possible will be restored when a sysout is resumed.  Described inInterlisp Reference Manual.PIPES   A mechanism consisting of a ring-buffer connecting a pair of streams - similar to UNIX pipes.  Some pipe-related functions, such as a TEE filter and a special form to create a pipeline - a number of processes whose primary input/output streams are connected together.  A function which opens a stream and posts the RESETSAVES to tidy up.PLAY	Offers Interlisp-D users a disciplined way to play simplemusical melodies on Xerox 1108 machines.  (PLAY.DEMO) demos the PLAYpackage.  Main functions: PLAY.NOTES, PLAY.MELODY, PLAY.KEYBOARD.PLOT Functions to help in the construction of interactive analytic plots.PRESSTOIP	PRESS TO InterPress.  Converts PRESS files toINTERPRESS files.  Call: (PRESS.TO.IP PRESSFILE IPFILE).PRINTERMENU  Creates a menu whose items are members of DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST.  Selecting an item causes it to be placed at the front of DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST, thus making it the default printer.  Selecting the title bar allows for adding and deleting printers from DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST.  Full description in PRINTERMENU.TEDIT.PRINTL	Function which prints circular list structures.  Described inInterlisp Reference Manual.PROFILETOOL	Creates a specialized InspectorWindow for enumeratingand changing variables, etc.  Useful for creating a graphicalinterface to attributes of any "package" written in Interlisp.PROMPTREMINDERS	User can be periodically reminded of important thingsby messages which are aggressively winked and flashed in thePROMPTWINDOW.PROOFREADER	A simple program to find spelling errors in a TEdit document.

Implements Cedar RPC transportmechanism allowing Interlisp-D to export services to or importservices from remote machines.SAMPLER	Graphics demo ("from Upstate New York"). Call (SAMPLER).SERVERSTATUS	Given a list of file and print servers, serverstatus periodically checks to see if they are up.  It allows programs to ask for the last known status.  Also, it allows programs to be executed whenever the status of a server changes (this is useful for modifying the variable DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST whenever a printer goes down).SETF	SET Field.  MACLISP SETF-style record accessing.  E.g.,(r.f d) => (fetch (r f) of d) & (setf (r.f d) v) => (replace (r f) of d with v).  Less verbose than CLISP fetch & replace,but without the drawbacks of packing record accesses into atoms aswith CLISP infixes ":" and ".".SHOW	Adds a LISPXMACRO SHOW that will prettyprint value ofpreceding history events with syntax similar to ?? and REDO.  Alsodefines functions SHOW and IT.SIGNAL	CEDAR/MESA-like signal mechanism.  Allows signals to beraised, caught, examined, resumed, or exited.SIMPLEFNS	Some simple functions.

Call:(SOLO).SPACEWINDOW	Puts a small "Space Allocation" window on screen.Shows a bar-chart of the amounts of the four types of memory spacethat have been allocated (fixed data, variable data, atoms, pnames).Display is updated every 60 seconds.STOCKICONS	 Use with ICONW.  A collection of stock icon windowssuitable for use with ICONW.STYLESHEET	 Package which allows user to create a block of menuswhich pop up all at once and don't go away until the user has dealtwith all the menus in the block and indicated that he is done.SYSTAT	Redefines the CONTROL-T interrupt channel to put up a graphicdisplay instead of the usual type out.  Leftbuttoning SYSTAT.WINDOWdoes an immediate Update.  Middlebuttoning SYSTAT.WINDOW gives userchoice among Quickly mode, Slowly mode, Updating, Deactivating, andReactivating.TESTPAT	Test pattern(?).  Doesn't work.TMENU	 Provides: (1) Interactive menus intended for reducing typing.Selected menu items are inserted into the TTY inpu buffer.

Easy to create programs that respond to"commands" or sequenced entry with a varied amount of prompting forinput.TTYIO	 Selective input fns: ASKFLE, ASKFN, ASKINT, ASKITEM, ASKITEMS,ASKRL, ASKYN.TURING  A Turing Machine game.  You specify a set of states and transitions, and a starting tape configuration and TM graphically executes them, reading and writing the tape as it goes.  Demos included.  Call: (TM)TWOD	A two-d graphics package.  Rather Siggraph-esque.TWODGRAPHICS implements viewports and world to window transformations.TXDT	Collection of Interlisp functions designed for those who wishto build text editors in Interlisp.  Inserting, deleting, searchingand manipulating text in buffers.  Undoable modifications.  Provisionsfor fonts.YAPFF is Yet Another Page Full Function. I actually don't like this onemuch better than any of the others around, but its another point in thespace of possible actions on end-of-page.WINDOWACCESS	Contains ACCESSFNS for all the standard windowproperties, allowing user to write code using fetch and replaceinstead of WINDOWPROP function calls.        GACHA 
