READBRUSH (by Masinter).Reads in the ".brush" files that the Mesa hackers have put  together on their own Hacks directory -- just some random graphics. Load in this package and READBRUSH(BIGFISH). It actually goes off to mesa hacks directory to get the files. Useful at University Grant sites that have the UGrant brushes, too.Adds an Idle hack, which then smoothly glides an image around on the screen. Select Gliding Box, and roll off and get "Pick Image from MesaHacks". This will take a while the first time, to get you a big menu of all of the files on the Hacks directory. (Currently "{Goofy:OSBU North:Xerox}&lt;Hacks&gt;Data&gt;Brushes&gt;").Try Astronaut, FullMoon, BigFish and DonaldDuck.</pre>
