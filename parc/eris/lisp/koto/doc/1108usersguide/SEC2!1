EQUIPMENT6This chapter describes the equipment that comprises your 1108 workstation, and provides instructions for routine care and maintenance.2Introduction1The Xerox 1108 is a compact, personal Interlisp-D workstation consisting of a processor, display, keyboard, mouse, floppy disk drive, and a rigid disk drive.2Display1The display is a large format CRT (17" diagonal) with a high resolution bitmap (1024 x 808 pixels). Intensity is controlled by a lever under the left side of the screen. The display may be tilted back and forth to maximize comfort and minimize glare.2Keyboard1The keyboard consists of 78 keys, 24 of which are function keys. All 78 keys are unencoded. The function (KEYACTION keyname actions) can be used to define the interpretation of any key. The system variable \KEYNAMES lists the mnemonic names of the keys. The maximum allowed distance between keyboard and processor is approximately 8 feet.2Mouse1Two types of mice are available for use: a three-button optical mouse or a two-button mechanical mouse.  The Middle button function is simulated on the two-button mouse by "Left-Right" Chording.Using the Mouse1In some earlier Interlisp-D releases, it was necessary to use the "CENTER" function key above the main keyboard in place of the middle button on a two-button mouse.  Later releases of Interlisp-D allow you to simulate the  middle mouse button by "chording" the left and right buttons.Specifically, if Interlisp-D sees LEFT and RIGHT go down simultaneously, it considers that to be MIDDLE, rather than either LEFT or RIGHT.  The definition of "simultaneously" is within the interval defined by MOUSECHORDWAIT, below.  MIDDLE is considered to be down until BOTH LEFT and RIGHT come up.If you need to do a mouse operation that would require MIDDLE plus some other button down, you can free one (but never both) of the buttons by letting up on it while still holding the other one down.  The MIDDLE button is still considered to be down, but the freed button is now available to register up or down independently.  For example, on a 3-button mouse if you are reshaping a window using MIDDLE and want to switch corners, you press RIGHT while still holding down MIDDLE, move to the desired corner, and then let up on RIGHT.  To do the same thing on a 2-button mouse, after pressing LEFT+RIGHT to get MIDDLE, you let up on RIGHT while still holding LEFT.  This "frees" RIGHT from the chord, and you can now press down on RIGHT, move to the other corner, let up on RIGHT, all the while still holding LEFT.To get the combination LEFT + RIGHT, do not press them down at the same instant.  To get LEFT + MIDDLE + RIGHT, or to get combinations in which MIDDLE is not the first (logical) button to go down, it is necessary to use the CENTER key on the keyboard.The CENTER key continues to be a synonym for MIDDLE mouse, independent of the above.(MOUSECHORDWAIT MSECS) 	[Function]This function specifies the interval of time (in milliseconds) during which the LEFT and RIGHT buttons on a mouse must go down to be considered "simultaneous" and hence treated as MIDDLE.  It returns the previous setting. (MOUSECHORDWAIT) returns the current setting without changing it.  (MOUSECHORDWAIT NIL) disables chording.  The largest permissible setting is 1872 milliseconds, or almost 2 seconds.The system is conservatively initialized with (MOUSECHORDWAIT 50).  You may want to set it higher; 100 or even 200 might be acceptable.  One should be aware of the competing constraints. The lower the setting, the more difficult it is to chord (the more coordinated your fingers must be).  The higher the setting, the longer the system must wait when you press down LEFT or RIGHT alone before deciding that it's not going to turn into MIDDLE; hence, the less responsive the mouse might seem in such cases.2Processor1The processor houses a floppy disk drive, a 10, 20 or 42 Megabyte rigid disk, and six printed circuit boards: the I/O processor, Central processor, High Speed I/O processor, Memory Storage, Memory Control, and the Options board. A serial port (RS232) is located in the rear of the processor. If a 29 Megabyte rigid disk is used, it is housed in a separate box.2Rigid Disk1The rigid disk has a10, 29, or 42 Megabyte capacity. Depending on size, it is divided into two or more logical volumes. Each logical volume has a name and length. Instructions are provided for loading each volume with the appropriate software.2Floppy Disk Drive1The floppy disk drive is located on the front of the processor.To load a floppy disk:1.	Locate the floppy disk drive on your processor. If the door is not open, press the long, narrow bar (with the circle in the center) immediately below the drive.2.  Floppy disks normally are labeled to indicate which side should go in and which side should be facing up.3.	When the disk is fully into the drive, you will hear a click. When you release the disk, it will pop out if it was not fully into the drive.4. 	Press down on the door firmly to close it.To Unload a floppy disk:1.	Make sure the red read/write light (circle in the center of the drive door bar) is not illuminated.2.	 Press the drive door bar.3. 	 Remove the disk and store it in its jacket.When storing floppy disks, keep them away from magnets, dust, and heat. Do not bend them. Do not write on their labels with ball-point pens or pencils of any sort. Any of these actions could damage the disk and prevent successful use of it.2RS232 Serial Interfaces1Two serial ports are available: a standard RS232 port and a TTY port, labeled Printer/DTE (Data Terminal Equipment.) Xerox supplies a standard cable for the latter; special cabling is required by the former, depending on the particular application. For a complete description of RS232 software support, please consult documentation for the RS232 Lisp Library package.2 Positioning the Equipment1To make sure the Xerox technical representative has enough room to access the display screen, position the display so that there is a total of 14 inches minimum on the sides. The processor should be positioned to provide access to  the  front  panel of the unit. You will need access to the front panel to load floppy disks turn the processor on and off, or boot the system. Make sure there is sufficient air movement around the processor, so it is not damaged by the heat it produces. The back of the processor must be at least six inches from the wall. If possible, provide enough space around the processor for servicing by the Xerox technical representative. An area 4 feet long by 6 feet wide, or an area that size in front of the processor so that it can be pulled out, is sufficient for servicing. The processor should be positioned in a permanent location.  Bumping and jarring it hard enough, even when turned off, can destroy the magnetic heads or the media. If you must move the processor, take care not to suddenly jolt or bump it.  Make sure the disk drive heads are locked down, and the spindle is secured before you move the processor. If you are not sure how to do this, contact your Xerox service representative.  2Routine Maintenance1Once a month, or after every twentieth time that you use the floppy disk drive, clean the floppy disk drive heads.If the magnetic heads are not kept clean, they can accumulate deposits that will cause scratching and erasure of data on the disks while reading and writing.Cleaning the Floppy Disk Drive Heads1Use the following procedure to clean the floppy disk drive heads with a Xerox head cleaning kit:1.	Remove the cleaning disk from its white jacket.2.	If you are using a disk that has not been used before, remove the perforated tab from the black disk jacket.3.	Turn the head cleaning disk over and dispense about ½ teaspoon of the disk cleaning solution over the large cutout area.4.	Insert the head cleaning disk into the floppy disk drive with the perforated tab facing upward.5.	Do a 10-boot.6.	When the maintenance panel displays 0076, press the ALT B button. 0077 will be displayed for about 15 seconds while the drive is being cleaned, then 0076 will be displayed once again.7.	Press the floppy disk drive latch and remove the head-cleaning disk. Place an X in the appropriate usage box on the disk.  When the disk has been used 13 times, it should be discarded.Note:	Head cleaning can also be performed by running diagnostics from the base state, selecting Floppy Disk Drive, and then selecting Clean Heads. Explicit prompting is supplied by the Clean Heads command.Cleaning the Mouse Pad, and Checking the Mouse1Brush or wipe the dust from the surface of the plastic mouse pad, since dust can interfere with the ball bearings of the two-button mouse, and the lens of the three-button mouse. Move the mouse in circles on the mouse pad and check the movement of the cursor on the display screen to make sure it is operating smoothly. If you see any hesitation in the movement of the cursor or feel the ball bearings rubbing (two-button mouse), it should be cleaned by a Xerox technical representative.Cleaning the Display Screen1Lightly wipe your display screen with a damp cloth or spray it with window cleaner. CAUTION:	Do not allow any liquid to drip down into the housing around the screen.Cleaning the Keyboard1Brush off the keyboard to keep dust from building up under the keys.     (LIST ((PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC  ) STARTINGPAGE# 15) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC  )) (180 204 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGR) (144 216 468 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (144 228 324 528) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC)) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD LEFT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (144 204 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGV) (144 216 468 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE VERSOHEAD) (144 756 468 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (144 228 324 510) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC)) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (180 204 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGR) (144 216 468 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE RECTOHEAD) (144 756 468 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (144 228 324 510) NIL)))))       1 T rD        r D                         . T TD       D                         1 T ŠD 
