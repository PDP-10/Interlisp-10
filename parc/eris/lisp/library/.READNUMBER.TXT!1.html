The user's selectionson the digits are accumulated in a displayed total.  The number pad includes abackspace key (bs), a clear key (clr) and an +/- key (-).  When 'ok' is selected,the total is returned.If MSG is given, it is printed at the top of the menu. If POSITION is a position,the menu will be put there; otherwise it will be put under the cursor.  IfMSGFONT is a font, MSG will be printed in it.  If DIGITFONT is a font, thelabels on the number pad keys will be printed in it.  The default for MSGFONTis '(helvetica 12).  The default for DIGITFONT is '(helvetica 18).Example of use:(RNUMBER '(How many WIDGITS would you like?))</pre>
