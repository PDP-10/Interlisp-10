File:    [Phylum]<LispUsers>PAGEHOLD.ttyCreated:  May 21, 1984, by JonL WhitePAGEHOLD advises PAGEFULLFN to achieve  **** No video inversion of the TTY window when being "held"  **** Automatic release of "hold" after a certain interval of time   **** Continued holding while either shift key is being depressed  **** Immediate release of holding when a shift key is released        (from having been depressed, of course)  **** Reversion to system-installed default behaviour if the CTRL        key is depressed during "holding".The aforementioned "interval of time" is held in the variable             PAGE.WAIT.SECSwhose default setting is 10.  A setting of 0 causes immediateauto-release  -- i.e., no "holding" -- unless a shift key isdepressed, in which case it "holds" until release of the shift.A non-numeric value in PAGE.WAIT.SECS merely invokes the system-installed "holding" behaviour.Future extensions:    Currently, there is no indication of holding other than thequiescent state of printing to the TTY window;  I plan to adda feature whereby an informative phrase will be alternativelywinked on and off in the title of a "held" window.  Also, pressing a shift or CTRL key is the only way (other thantimeout) to release a "hold"; I plan to permit mousing the titleregion to cause release too.
