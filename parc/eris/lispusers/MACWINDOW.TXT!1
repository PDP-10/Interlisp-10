MACWINDOWMitch Lichtenberg (Lichtenberg.wbst@Xerox)Makes SHRINKW and EXPANDW zoom like Apple's Mac.Known problems:It'd be nice to know where the icon of a window that has never been shrunk before will go...  (I didn't see a pattern)I have to change it somehow so when the window is close to where its icon goes, it will use fewer steps (or go faster)./Mitch.
