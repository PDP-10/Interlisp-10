LINEDEMO documentationThis package contains a couple of random demonstration programs:(POLYGONS W NOBLOCK TIMER)	call (POLYGONS) or (POLYGONS window) to perpetually draw polygons in the given window (it (re)uses POLYGONSWINDOW if argument is NIL). To run in the background, you can ADD.PROCESS((POLYGONS (CREATEW]. Controlled somewhat by the global parameters POLYGONMINPTS (minimum number of vertices), POLYGONMAXPTS (maximum number of vertices), POLYGONSTEPS (number of steps between min and max), and delays POLYGONWAIT (time between different polygons) and POLYGONWAIT2 (delay between initial display of beginning and end and the movement phase.)	If NOBLOCK is T, it doesn't block at all (runs after but can't run in background.) If TIMER is given, then POLYGONS will stop after TIMER is expired. (Used by the demo system.)(LINES W)	similar to POLYGONS in controls, but draws perpetually changing form using line draw. Controlled by single variable LINECNT, which is read at startup as number of lines visible at any one time. Both POLYGONS and LINES adjust themselves to the size of the window, so you can reshape the window in the middle of the demo.This file also has a 'fadeto' primitive, for showing one bitmap slowly fading into another in a window. (FADETO TO FROM WAIT) will modify FROM to look like TO.</pre>
