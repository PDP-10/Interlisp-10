Shulman]@comment(for Xerox Corporation)@end(titlepage)@Chapter(Introduction)@Section(Purpose)@b(TUTOR) is a program whose purpose is to introduce the user to Interlispand mainly to the Interlisp-D development environment.  @b(TUTOR) takes theprogrammer (who is assumed to have minimal Lisp exposure) through:@begin(Itemize)A short introduction to some aspects of the @b(TUTOR) environment andprogram interaction.Keyboard idiosyncrasies, how to use the mouse and what windows are.Menus and interactive window operations.Lisp variables, data types and the Record Package.Basic Lisp and FunctionsFunction definitionFunction editingThe Break package and Data InspectorMAKEFILEThe compiler@end(Itemize)all at a fairly basic level.  It does this in a light, cheerful, andentertaining manner.  @b(TUTOR) is started by the function @b(TUTOR).@Section(Environment)Interlisp-D provides a rich and complete Lisp development environmentwhich include things like:@begin(Itemize)A MouseMultiple WindowsMenusMulti-tasking@end(Itemize)which @b(TUTOR) not only teaches, but takes full advantage of in doingthe teaching.The basic @b(TUTOR) environment consists of:@begin(Itemize)Prompt Window - This is @i(standard) to the Interlisp-D programmingenvironment.  @b(TUTOR) uses this window at times when the user wouldnormally be interacting with Interlisp-D here.Top Level Typescript Window - This is also @i(standard) to Interlisp-D.This is the main window the user would use to communicate with Interlisp-Dthrough.  For this reason it is also the main window the user interacts with@b(TUTOR) through.  @b(TUTOR) does most of its @i(talking) and the user mostof his @i(speaking) via this window.Tutor Help Window - This window is used by @b(TUTOR) to provide additionalhelp to the user at the users request.  The user can request additionalhelp either by typing @b(help) to any prompt from @b(TUTOR) or by buttoningthe large @b(HELP) menu located above this window.Tutor Help Menu - This is a single item menu (the item @b(HELP)) that residesabove the @i(Tutor Help Window).  At any time the user can get additionalhelp printed in the @i(Tutor Help Window) by buttoning this menu.Tutor Lesson Window - This window contains the @i(Table of Contents) of all@i(lessons) available through @b(TUTOR).  The current lesson is shown byinverting it.  This window can also be used to skip around various lessonsand review past lessons.@end(Itemize)When @b(TUTOR) is first started the above five items are grouped togetherin a coherent fashion that keeps the users attention within a certain areaof the screen.  This leaves large empty areas to be used by @b(TUTOR)when necessary.@b(TUTOR) also provides facilities to suspend the tutoring saving the userscurrent position for resumption at a later date.A standard user input interface is provided which first @i(screens) the usersinput to see if he needs further help or wishes to suspend the tutoringsession.  Help is available at two levels:  If the user types @b(?) toa prompt he will get a brief sentence printed right in the @i(Top LevelTypescript Window) explaining what input is requested; if the user types@b(Help) (or buttons the @b(HELP) menu) he will receive a more detailedexplanation of what is requested in the @i(Tutor Help Window).The @b(TUTOR) system also @i(protects) the user from accidentally abortingtutoring by disabling the normal interrupt mechanisms.  It reactivatesthe ERROR and RESET interrupt but in a protected shell.Typing the ERROR interrupt (@b(&uarr;E)) at prompt level will cause theuser to be re-prompted.  Typing it during @b(TUTOR) typeout will leavethe user at @b(TUTOREXEC) level.  If the user typed it by accident hecan resume at the beginning of the @i(section) he interrupted by typing@b(resume).Typing the RESET interrupt (@b(&uarr;D)) will immediately cause thesystem to go into a RESET trap.  At this point the user will beasked (in the system @i(Prompt Window)) whether he really meant totype the RESET interrupt.  If he answers @b(No) then @b(TUTOR)will proceeded as if nothing happened.  If he answers @b(Yes) then@b(TUTOR) will reset itself leaving the user back at Lisp level.@Chapter(System Description)This chapter gives an overview of the @b(TUTOR) system; the files itneeds, and the globals and functions it has.  Each global isthen listed along with its purpose.  Following the globals are thefunctions that make up @b(TUTOR).  Included are their arguments, returnedvalue and a description of what they do.@Section(Files)@b(TUTOR) is composed of the main file, the lesson files and auxiliaryfiles.  The student may also have is own suspended lesson file.They are described as follows:@subsection(Main File)The main file (called @B(TUTOR)) contains most all the functions necessaryto run the @b(TUTOR) system.  In addition it contains all the globals, variables, recordsand the introductory lesson.  This is the file the user must load tostart up the system.@subsection(Lesson Files)Each full lesson is kept in its own separate file.  This file is loadedautomatically when it is needed.  The files are named @b(TUTORLESSONx)where @b(x) is the lesson number.  These files do not have to residein the same place as the main file.  The variable @b(TUTORLESSONDIRECTORIES)is a search list (like the variable DIRECTORIES and LISPUSERSDIRECTORIES)which should contain the location of the lesson files.@b(TUTORLESSONDIRECTORIES) is an INITVAR whose initial value is({DSK} T NIL).  The site administrator should set up the appropriatevalue in the site init file if different.@subsection(Auxiliary files)Two extra system files and two Lisp User's packages are also necessaryto run the @b(TUTOR) system.  There are @i(PRINTOUT), @i(RECORDER), @i(ACTIVEREGIONS) and@i(ICONW).  These will be loaded when @b(TUTOR) is loaded.  They should befound in DIRECTORIES (for @i(PRINTOUT)) and in LISPUSERSDIRECTORIES (for@i(ACTIVEREGIONS) and @i(ICONW).)@i(PRINTOUT) contains functions that enhance the capabilities of the@b(printout) package.  @i(RECORDER) is a package the lets mouse andkeyboard actions be played back.@i(ACTIVEREGIONS) and @i(ICONW) are standardLisp User's packages.@subsection(Student File)When a student @b(suspend)'s his lesson a file is created to holdwhat is necessary to @b(resume) where he left off.  This file isnamed @b(TUTOR-username.firstname).  @b(username) is the studentsuser name and @b(firstname) is his first name.  This file is keptin the directory described by @b(TUTORSTUDENTDIRECTORY).@b(TUTORSTUDENTDIRECTORY) is an INITVAR whose initial value is {DSK}.The site administrator should set up the appropriate value in thesite init file if different.  This variable can be set to anythinga single entry of @i(USERGREETFILES) can be set to and will behaveappropriately.@Section(Organization)@b(TUTOR) is organized around the concept of a @i(lesson).  Each maintopic is an entire @i(lesson).  These lessons are further broken up into@i(sections).  A @i(section) is the smallest unit the user can repeat or@b(suspend) a tutoring session at.  Except for the introductory lessoneach lesson is kept in its own separate file.  Each file is loaded asnecessary by the system automatically.@i(Sections) are implemented by separate Lisp functions.  Theconvention used in naming these functions is @b(L)@i(lesson#)@b(.)@i(section#).For example the function that implements @i(lesson) 2, @i(section) 4 wouldbe called @b(L2.4).@subsection(Lesson Scheduling)Section scheduling is handled by the @b(TUTOREXEC) rather then havingeach section chain to the next.  @b(TUTOREXEC) provides the @i(protected)Lisp executive for the entire system.  It handles section schedulingby evaluating the global variable @b(*NEXT*) which should contain thefunction implementing the next @i(section).  Each @i(section) isresponsible for setting the next @i(section) by a call to the function@b(NEXT.LESSON) which maintains the @i(Tutor Lesson Window), loadsthe lesson file if necessary, and sets @b(*NEXT*) appropriately.@subsection(Standard Output)The macro @b(MESSAGE) provides the standard output interface for each@i(section) function.  This macro is used somewhat like the Interlisp@b(printout) facility (which it does indeed compile into) to provideboth the general @b(TUTOR) dialogue as well as the help messages printedin the @i(Tutor Help Window).  In addition to excepting @b(printout)forms it handles bitmaps and strings.Bitmaps are handled by the .BM @b(printout) command which is among theextra features added by loading @b(PRINTOUT).Strings are translated into lists which are used for the @b(printout)form @b(.PARA).@subsection(Standard Input)The standard input function to receive any input from the user is @b(USER.INPUT).  This function provides a @i(protected) interfaceto @b(PROMPTFORWORD) to trap ERROR interrupts.  This functionalso recognizes special user input for help and tutorial suspensionseparate from the requested input.@Section(Globals)@subsection(System globals)@paragraph(TUTORLESSONDIRECTORIES)This variable contains the list of directories to be searched for alesson file.  It corresponds to the Interlisp variables @i(DIRECTORIES)and @i(LISPUSERSDIRECTORIES).  It is an INITVAR whose initial value is({DSK} T NIL).@paragraph(TUTORSTUDENTDIRECTORY)The value of this variable is used to construct the full file name ofwhere a student's @b(suspend)'ed file is kept.  Its value can be anatomic HOST/DIRECTORY or a list that is PACK'ed to form an atomicHOST/DIRECTORY (with this form the atom USER will have the student'suser name substituted before PACKing.)  It corresponds to a singleentry in the Interlisp variable @i(USERGREETFILES).  It is an INITVARwhose initial value is {DSK}.@paragraph(*KEYBOARD.WINDOW*)Window used to display the keyboard layout in.@paragraph(*LESSON.NAMES*)An alist of @i(lesson) numbers and titles.  Used in the @i(Tutor LessonWindow)@paragraph(*LESSON.WINDOW*)This is the window that contains the @i(Table of Contents) of the lessonsavailable in @b(TUTOR).  The window property LESSON is the number of thecurrent @b(TUTOR) @i(lesson).@paragraph(*MAIN.WINDOW.REGION*)This is the region the main tty window is reshaped to by @b(TUTOR.INIT).@paragraph(*NEXT*)If non-NIL evaluated by @b(TUTOREXEC) when it gains control.  Used toschedule the next lesson @i(section).  Set by the function @b(NEXT.LESSON).@paragraph(*PROMPT.REGION*)This is the region the prompt window is reshaped to by @b(TUTOR.INIT).@paragraph(*TUTOR.HELP.MESSAGE*)Contains the @b(printout) expansion for the current help message.  Setby the MESSAGE macro and used by the function @b(TUTOR.HELP).@paragraph(*TUTOR.HELP.WINDOW*)The @i(Tutor Help Window).@subsection(Reference Pages)@paragraph(*PP.INTERRUPT-CHARACTERS*)Page that describes the interrupt characters.@paragraph(*PP.MENUS*)Starting page for description of menus.@subsection(Bitmaps)@begin(Description)2B.MOUSE@\Two button mouse. 9 by 16.3B.MOUSE@\Three button mouse. 12 by 16.DLIONKBD@\Dandelion keyboard icon. 72 by 72.DOLPHINKBD@\Dolphin keyboard icon. 72 by 72.DORADOKBD@\Dorado keyboard icon. 72 by 72.DOWN.ARROW@\Downward pointing arrow. 10 by 16.FROWN@\Frowning face. 16 by 16.IS.OPR.BM.1@\Smiling I.S.
