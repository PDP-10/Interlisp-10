                    LispUsers Package  PATCHUP	                           Danny Bobrow                          7 November 1982PATCHUP is a LISPUSERS package which facilitates multiuserinteraction on a system.  It is designed to allow dumping of apatch file containing changes from a number of files.  One calls:       (PatchUp filesOrEditFlg patchFileName)If filesOrEditFlg = a list of file names, then changes which havebeen made to items on those files will be dumped on patchFileName.Also included will be any changes that have not been associatedwith any file.If filesOrEditFlg=T, then a COMS list of all changes in the systemwill be computed, and the user will be left in the editor editingthis COMS list.  Upon exiting from the editor, the revised COMSlist will be used for dumping.If patchFileName is not given, then a file name of the form	<date>-<userName>.PATCHis used.  For example,	(PatchUp LOOPSFILES)could dump all changes made to items on LOOPSFILES to a file named	9-NOV-82-BOBROW.PATCH
