				EDITFONT     By Kelly Roach.  Last revised 29-Jan-84.     EDITFONT gives the user functions for creating and edittingDISPLAY fonts which can be read and written as STRIKE font files.The following functions are provided to the user:     (1) (EDITFONT FONT).  FONT may be any DISPLAY FONTDESCRIPTORdatatype.  The user will be presented with a matrix of 257 characterbitmaps.  The 257th char is the dummy char, used as a default forunspecified chars.  Buttoning a character bitmap with the LEFT mousebutton will call EDITBM on that character bitmap.  Buttoning acharacter bitmap with the MIDDLE mouse button pops up a menu thatallows the user to STOP (abort EDITFONT), OK (save EDITFONT's workinto FONT), or DUMMY (make selected character an unspecified char).     (2) (BLANKFONTCREATE FAMILY SIZE FACE ROTATION DEVICEFIRSTCHAR LASTCHAR ASCENT DESCENT WIDTH).  This function will create ablank font for the user.  Charcodes not between FIRSTCHAR and LASTCHARare left unspecified.  WIDTH may be a number, causing WIDTH to be thewidth of every character; or WIDTH may be a list of 	(IPLUS LASTCHAR (IMINUS FIRSTCHAR) 2)numbers, determining the width for each specified char plus the dummychar.  Another good way to get a fresh font is to do a COPYALL of somealready existing fontdescriptor (e.g. (COPYALL (FONTCREATE 'GACHA10))).  Use Interlisp's SETFONTDESCRIPTOR function to make your fontsknown to Interlisp's FONTCREATE.     (3) (READSTRIKEFONTFILE FAMILY SIZE FACE FILE).  Reads STRIKEfont FILE, returning a fontdescriptor.     (4) (WRITESTRIKEFONTFILE FONT FILE).  Writes FONT out to STRIKEfile FILE.  Can be read back in with READSTRIKEFONTFILE.  You can putyour STRIKE font files on FONTCREATE's search path by adding yourfont directory to Interlisp's global FONTDIRECTORIES.     (5) AN IMPORTANT NOTE:  The user is hereby warned that it isgenerally not a good idea to EDITFONT an existing font directly.I.e., instead of	(EDITFONT (FONTCREATE 'GACHA 10))I recommend	(EDITFONT (COPYALL (FONTCREATE 'GACHA 10)))The reason you should be wary of editing an already existing font, isthat the Interlisp WINDOW package caches certain parts of InterlispFONTDESCRIPTORs on its windows.  EDITFONT doesn't know about thiscached info, and if you smash a font that the WINDOW package is alsousing, you may get some funny looking characters or worse.     Comments and bugs can be sent to ROACH.PA.</pre>
