COMPILEFORMSLISTcontains a single function COMPILEFORMSLIST:compileformslist[var] compiles the list of forms bound to VAR as a singlefunction, and then changes the binding of VAR so that it simply callsthat function.  The symbolic definition is saved on the propertylist of the function-name (which is gensymed) for future reference.This function may be called repeatedly.Example:  Executing (COMPILEFORMSLIST 'AFTERSYSOUTFORMS) before a sysoutcan speed up subsequent entries into that sysout.Comments to Ron Kaplan
