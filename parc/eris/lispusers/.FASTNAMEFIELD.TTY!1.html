FASTNAMEFIELD:This package contains code which speeds up UNPACKFILENAME,FILECOMS, NAMEFIELD and FILENAMEFIELD at the expense of some space:namely, when the value of FILECOMS or UNPACKFILENAME or NAMEFIELDis required, it looks the atom up in a hash table and returns itif found; if not found, it computes the value and stores it.This turns out to make a significant difference to file packagemanipulations.If you tell GAINSPACE to clear the file package information,it will also CLRHASH these arrays.Larry Masinter</pre>
