BLTDEMO.TXTMost of you have probably seen the neat Smalltalk demo - the window with thespinning star and the bouncing ring and box.  Well, now you can see it on yourLisp system. Call (BOUNCE x y), where x and y are velocities in the x and ydirections respectively.  x and y default to 3 if omitted.  You will beprompted to open a window.  The box shows whatever is near the cursor. Interesting recursive effects can be seen if you move the cursor near the box.(Submitted by Denber.WBST@parc-maxc)
