CHUNK-MENU documentationD. Austin Henderson, Jr.Initially released: May 11, 1983 Last revised: May 11, 1983&lt;LISPUSERS&gt;CHUNK-MENU (and .DCOM) permits the creation and use ofpop-up menus for long lists of items. The user sees one "chunk" ofthe list at a time. Menu items at the top and bottom allow him tomove backward and forward in the list (to preceding or followingchunks) and to "thumb" to a desired chunk via a menu of "firstlines". Comments and suggestions welcome &lt;AHENDERSON.PA@PARC&gt;.CHUNK.MENU.CREATE (ITEMS CHUNK.COUNT TITLE CENTERFLG MENUFONTITEMWIDTH ITEMHEIGHT MENUBORDERSIZE MENUOUTLINESIZE) Creates achunk menu for the menu items ITEMS. The chunks are menus with nomore than CHUNK.COUNT items. The menus have menu characteristicsgiven by the rest of the parameters (see the discussion of menus inthe Interlisp-D User's Guide). Returns the chunk menu.CHUNK.MENU.MENU (CHUNK.MENU POSITION) Activates (pops-up)CHUNK.MENU centered at POSITION. If position is not specified, theposition of the cursor is used. The user can select items, or moveto other chunks by using the up, down, and thumbing entries. Allchunks appear centered at POSITION or the original position of thecursor (prevents the menus from "walking" across the display. Whenan item is selected, the value returned is as specified for itemsof menus. CHUNK.MENU is modified so that the next activation willstart in the chunk visible when the selction was made (it rememberswhich chunk the last selection was made in).</pre>
