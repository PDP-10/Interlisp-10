The REMIND package is a facility for scheduling LISP events totake place at a specified later time.  For instance, you may say	(REMIND (IN 10 MINUTES) (PRIN1 "GO HOME"))	or	(REMIND (EVERY 2 HOURS)(SYSOUT 'WORK.SAV))	or	(REMIND (TOMORROW AT 12:30) "meeting with Joe")Reminders are stored on REMINDERS.LISP on your directory, andan entry on AFTERSYSOUTFORMS causes them to be loaded via LOADREMINDERS; you might also want to call LOADREMINDERS via your INIT.LISP file, and you can always call it explicitly.The hook into the system is through a call to CHECKREMINDERSthe package puts on PROMPTCHARFORMS (and removes when thereare no reminders).**** NOTE: in all functions, NIL for LISTNAME = REMINDERLST ****REMIND(WHEN WHAT LISTNAME IDATE)	An NLAMBDA.  Deciphers WHEN and adds an appropriate entry	to LISTNAME.  Whenever LISTNAME is not NIL, an entry on	PROMPTCHARFORMS causes the reminders to be checked against	the current time.  For any reminders for which the specified	time has passed, WHAT will be executed. IDATE is not a useful	parameter in a user call to REMIND.	WHAT can be an arbitrary expression to be evaluated.	It can also be a string, atom, or a list (QUOTE atom), in 	which case what will be evaluated is a call to the function	REMINDER which will print the string, atom's value, or atom	respectively, then prompt for a response.  At that time you	can either say OK, or give a new time to be (re-)reminded.	WHEN can be an atom, string, or list.  Strings must be full	date and time specifications as indicated in the TENEX JSYS	manual (as can be given to LISP's IDATE).  Atoms are 	interpreted the same as the list (AT atom).  Non-strings	are converted to all upper case.SHOWREMINDERS(LISTNAME)	Displays reminders on LISTNAME and prompts for actions.	For [confirm] type options, &uarr;E is the way to say "no", in which	case you will be prompted again for a response.  The options are:		Nothing		Delete [confirm]		Edit entry [confirm]		Change time [confirm]		Quit		List rest (show remainder but don't ask for action)NOREMINDERS()	Turns off the entire reminder package, including:		deleting the reminder list(s)		removing the AFTERSYSOUTFORM that loads reminders		removing CHECKREMINDERS from PROMPTCHARFORMS	Does not affect the reminder file(s).**** The following functions are not normally called by the user ****LOADREMINDERS(LISTNAME FILENAME)	Loads reminders from FILENAME to LISTNAME.  If FILENAME = NIL	it is determined from the A-list REMINDERFILES and LISTNAME.	[Thus, (LOADREMINDERS) loads reminders from REMINDER.LISP	to the list REMINDERLST.  (LOADREMINDERS) is called when REMIND	is loaded and when starting up a SYSOUT which included REMIND.  A 	natural time to call this is just after loading the REMIND package, perhaps	in your LISP initialization.]STOREREMINDERS(LISTNAME FILENAME)	Every time LISTNAME is changed by one of the functions in this	package, it is written out onto FILENAME (old version).	If FILENAME = NIL, the same convention as for LOADREMINDERS 	applies.CHECKREMINDERS(LISTNAME)	Moves through the entries on LISTNAME checking the current	time against the time in the entry. If the entry time is	past the current time, the WHAT part of the entry is	executed and the next entry is checked; if the time has	not yet past, the function exits.  (This list is presumed	to be sorted, earliest time first).INSERTREMINDER(TIM WHAT LISTNAME)	Inserts (LIST TIM WHAT) on LISTNAME sorted according to TIM. REMINDER(WHAT LISTNAME)	Prints WHAT and asks for a response.  OK acknowledges	the reminder, causing it do disappear.  Anything else	is interpreted as a new time for requeueing of WHAT	on LISTNAME via a call to REMIND.There are various formats for WHEN:1. IN		(IN 2 HOURS 3 MIN)		(IN 1 MIN)		(IN 4 MONTHS)		(IN 1 WK)		(IN 2 MIN 30 SECS)	all do the obvious.  Acceptable units are:		seconds:  SECONDS, SECOND, SECS, SEC, S		minutes:  MINUTES, MINUTE, MINS, MIN		hours:    HOURS, HOUR, HRS, HR, HR		days:     DAYS, DAY, D	[1 day = 24 hours]		months:   MONTHS, MONTH	[1 month = 28 days]2. AT (or ON)		5PM		3		12:30		4:22:30		(AT 4:30)		(ON MONDAY 5PM)		TOMORROW = TOMMORROW = TOMOROW = TOMMOROW		(TODAY 6:30)		(5 JUNE) = (JUNE 5)		(5 OCTOBER 9) = (OCT 9 5:00) = (5:00AM 9 October)		(TOMORROW NOON)		(THE 23)	= the next day which is the 23rd of the month		(ON THE 1 AT NOON)		(TOMORROW AT 5PM)	and so on.  Note that the single atom cases can be given to	REMIND without embedding in a list beginning with AT.  If no 	time of day is specified, it will be taken to be 1 second 	after midnight.  Note that the extraneous ON in the next to	last example and the extraneous AT in the last are allowed.	The interpretation of (TODAY 12:XX) with no AM or PM is	PM unless it is already past 12:XX PM, in which case it is	interpreted as tomorrow at 12:XX AM.3. EVERY		(EVERY 2 HOURS)		(EVERY 2 MINUTES 30 S)		(EVERY HOUR)		(EVERY QUARTER HOUR)		(EVERY HALF MINUTE)	same as in, except WHAT is embedded in an expression that	in addition to evaluating WHAT, will also requeue WHAT	for the specified amount of time after the time associated	with the just-evaluated expression.  Thus, if you go away	and the evaluation actually happens when you come back one	half hour after the time it was set for, and the interval is	every hour, the next occurrence will be in one half-hour,	not one hour.  In addition, you can specify to begin on the 	hour, half hour, or quarter hour for the first reminder:		(EVERY HOUR ON THE HALF HOUR)		(EVERY 20 MINUTES ON THE QUARTER HOUR)	This last will put the first reminder on the next quarter hour, then	a new one every twenty minutes after that.		Similarly:		(EVERY DAY AT . . .)		(EVERY MONDAY AT . . .)		(EVERY n AT . . .) where n is a day-of-month, like 18	Following the AT is a time expression.  Note that	(EVERY DAY AT 11) will be rescheduled for 11AM if it is	before 11AM, or 11PM if it is before 11PM, or tomorrow at	11AM if it is between 11PM and midnight.  Finally, the next	three are special forms which implie 1 second after	midnight as the time of day:		(EVERY DAY)		(EVERY TUES)		(EVERY 22)4. FOR	If following one of the above kinds of expressions (within the same list)	there is the atom FOR followed by the same kind of time expression	that can follow the atom IN as described above, then WHAT will not	be performed if the remind time has past by more than the amount	of time specified by the FOR expression.  However, if WHENEXP	is an EVERY expression, the reminder will be appropriately requeued.	For example, the time is now 11:50AM.  You type		(REMIND (IN 5 MINUTES FOR 10 MINUTES) (PRIN1 "XXX"))	then the first time after 11:55 that the promptcharacter is printed	if it is still before 12:05 "XXX" will be printed, but if you have not 	done something for so long that it is now past 12:05, "XXX" will not	be printed.5. UNTIL	Similarly, if instead of FOR you include one of (TO TIL TILL UNTIL)	then the following time expression will be interpreted as for AT	expressions described above.  Note that in this case, the "current time"	is taken to be the time specified in the first part of the expression	not the current real time.  Thus, if is now 12:30PM Tuesday, then		(AT NOON UNTIL 1) means do WHAT anytime after	NOON Wednesday, but not if it is also past 1:00PM on Wednesday.	These kinds of range limitations are most useful in EVERY statements	such as (EVERY DAY AT NOON UNTIL 1) which means do it 	only between noon and 1.  Without the UNTIL in this, you would	get your probably irrelevant reminder whenever you next	started up LISP after the next NOON.</pre>
