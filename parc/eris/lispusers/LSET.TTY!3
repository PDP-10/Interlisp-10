				List SETs     By Kelly Roach.  Last Revised 21-Jul-84.  LSET containsfunctions for operating on sets and bags implemented as lists.Comments on the LSET package may be sent to ROACH.PA.     Set operations like LUNION comes in several flavors.     LUNION takes multiple arguments and uses EQUAL     LUNION2 takes 2 arguments and uses EQUAL     LUNIONQ takes multiple arguments and uses EQ     LUNIONQ2 takes 2 arguments and uses EQSet operations, which do tests with EQUAL, assume that the args thatare passed to them are in LSETIFY form-- that is, there are no EQUALduplicates within any arg.  Set operations, which do tests with EQ,assume that the args that are passed to them are in LSETIFYQform--there are no EQ duplicates within any arg.  It isn't necessarythat the user call LSETIFY or LSETIFYQ, if the user can guarantee thatthe args to LUNION, etc. do not have EQUAL or EQ duplicatesrespectively.     Basic set operations:UNION:        LUNION, LUNIONQ, LUNION2, LUNIONQ2INTERSECT:    LINTERSECT, LINTERSECTQ, LINTERSECT2, LINTERSECTQ2 SUBTRACT:     LSUBTRACT, LSUBTRACTQ, LSUBTRACT2, LSUBTRACTQ2     Miscellaneous useful set functions:(LUNIFY E L)	Returns LUNION of (LIST E) and L.(LUNIFYQ E L)	Returns LUNIONQ of (LIST E) and L.(LSETIFY L)	Returns L with all EQUAL duplicates deleted.(LSETIFYQ L)	Returns L with all EQ duplicates deleted.(LSUBSET X Y)	Returns T iff X is a subset of Y.(LSUBSETQ X Y)  Similar to LSUBSET but uses EQ.(LEQUAL X Y)   Returns T iff X equals Y.(LEQUALQ X Y)  Returns T iff X equals Y using EQ.     Bags (also known as multiset) are unordered lists similar tosets, but elements of bags may appear more than once inside the samebag.  Thus, (X Y X A A) and (A X Y X A) represent the same bagcontaining 2 occurences of A, 2 occurences of X, and 1 occurence of Y.There is no BBAGIFY or BBAGIFYQ functions similar to LSETIFY andLSETIFYQ since all finite undotted lists are already bags.     Basic bag operations:UNION:        BUNION, BUNIONQ, BUNION2, BUNIONQ2INTERSECT:    BINTERSECT, BINTERSECTQ, BINTERSECT2, BINTERSECTQ2 SUBTRACT:     BSUBTRACT, BSUBTRACTQ, BSUBTRACT2, BSUBTRACTQ2     Miscellaneous useful bag functions:(BUNIFY E L)	Returns BUNION of (LIST E) and L.(BUNIFYQ E L)	Returns BUNIONQ of (LIST E) and L.(BSUBBAG X Y)	Returns T iff X is a subbag of Y.(BSUBBAGQ X Y)  Similar to BSUBBAG but uses EQ.(BEQUAL X Y)   Returns T iff X equals Y.(BEQUALQ X Y)  Returns T iff X equals Y using EQ.
