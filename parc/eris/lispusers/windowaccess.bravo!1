WINDOWACCESSz19402x4e12c(0,5632)\f6bFile:	[Phylum]<LispUsers>WindowAccess.PressRevised:	February 2, 1983 by Martin Yonkez19402x4e12\f7This file contains one record declaration which declares ACCESSFNS for all the standard window properties.  This allows one to write code using fetch and replace instead of WINDOWPROP function calls.  Using CLOSEFN  as the example property, the following become equivalent:j(635)\1f6 57f7 9f6 78f7 6f6 4f7 7f6 12f7 11f6 23f7 8f6(fetch CLOSEFN of WINDOW)  = (WINDOWPROP WINDOW (QUOTE CLOSEFN))and(replace CLOSEFN of WINDOW with FOO) = (WINDOWPROP WINDOW (QUOTE CLOSEFN)  FOO)\1f7 26f6 3f7 35f0 7f7 37f6 2f7 40f0This also has the advantage that you can now ask questions to MASTERSCOPE  about CLOSEFN as a field.j\1f6 62f7 12f6 7f7 8f6
