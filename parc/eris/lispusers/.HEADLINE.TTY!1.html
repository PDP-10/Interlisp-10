HEADLINE documentationD. Austin Henderson, Jr.Last revised: August 5, 1982&lt;LISPUSERS&gt;HEADLINE (and .DCOM) contains three functions formanipulating windows which contain headlines ("headline windows").HEADLINE ( PHRASE FONT POSITION ALIGNMENT )Creates a headline window with Phrase printed in font Font atposition Position aligned as per Alignment; the window is justlarge enough to hold the headline. Phrase is any Lisp object. Fontdefines a font as per FONTCREATE (eg. (TIMESROMAN 18 BOLD) ); ifNIL, TimesromanD 36 is used. Position is a position giving thereference point for placing the window; if NIL, the user is given achance to position the window with MOVEW. If Postion is given,Alignment gives the alignment of the window with respect toPosition as (xalignment . yalignment) where xalignment is one ofLEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT and yalignment is one of BOTTOM, CENTER, orTOP; for convenience, if Position is CENTER then it is taken tomean (CENTER . CENTER), etc.BILLBOARD ( TITLES ALIGNMENT SEPARATION POSITION )Creates a set of vertically arranged headline windows. Titles is alist of (phrase font) sublists where phrase and font are as inHeadline. Alignment is one of LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT, indicatinghow the windows are aligned with each other; defaults to CENTER.Separation indicates the spacing between the bottoms of thewindows; defaults to 70. Position indicates where the top (first)of the windows is to appear; defaults to somewhere near the topcenter of the screen.CLOSEHEADLINES ( )Closes all the active headline windows.</pre>
