				SYSTAT     By Kelly Roach.  This simple package redefines Interlisp'sfunction CONTROL-T so that you get a graphic display instead of theusual printed status line when you type character <CONTROL-T>.The SYSTAT package puts up SYSTAT.WINDOW indicating USERNAME, TTY.PROCESS,STATE, STACK FRAME, %UTIL, % GC, % KEYBOARD, % SWAP, number of OPENFILES, MAIN DATA SPACE used, and ARRAY SPACE used.     SYSTAT.WINDOW may also be usefully buttoned with your mouse.Buttoning with LEFTBUTTON causes an immediate update of SYSTAT.WINDOW.A popup menu is available with MIDDLEBUTTON allowing you toenter Quickly and Slowly update modes, immediate Update, Deactivatethe SYSTAT.WINDOW, and Reactivate the SYSTAT.WINDOW.  The ordinairywindow menu is available with RIGHTBUTTON.  Closing the SYSTAT.WINDOWcauses SYSTAT to deactivate until your next <CONTROL-T> which willreactivate SYSTAT, opening SYSTAT.WINDOW.
