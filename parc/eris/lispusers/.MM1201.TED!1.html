				MM1201									Michel Denber									June 8, 1984MM1201 is a set of functions which allow you to easily control the operation of a Summagraphics MM1201 digitizing tablet connected to your D0 via the printer port.  Be sure you have RS232.DCOM loaded first.  To use MM1201, load &lt;Lispusers&gt;MM1201.DCOM and call (MM1201).  A menu will appear listing the operations you can perform.  You can set the digitizer's operating mode, resolution, roundoff, or scale.  You can also initialize the tablet, run its self-test, and get single points.  These functions should be fairly obvious if you have a copy of the Summagraphics manual.There is also a small Draw type program included which can be invoked by choosing the "Draw" menu item.  This will open a window into which you can draw with the tablet.  Push the stylus down (or hit puck button 1) to draw and push the stylus barrel button (or puck button 2) to erase.  Exit with &uarr;E.  The Draw window contains a menu in the lower left corner which allows you to select any of several predefined brushes, or sweep out any area of the screen to create a new brush ("Newbrush").  You can also draw in several modes, currently freehand or straight lines (curves is not implemented).  You can paint in paint or invert modes (standard bitblt meaning).</pre>
