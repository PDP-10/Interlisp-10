COMHACK works by hacking the insides of DWIM so that before translating any if or for expression, all comments are removed.  The advice is in terms of a function called \StripComments, which can be used to accomplish similar modification to any other clisp word.  The end result is that comments are allowed anywhere inside the affected form, and are never seen.  This means that in the unlikely event that your code was actually working by using a comment for value, it will cease to work.Henry Thompson (HThompson@CSLI)</pre>
