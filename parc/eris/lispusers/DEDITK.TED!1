DEDITK allows you to effect the following combinations of operations in DEDIT in a single buttoning:AFTER; BOBEFORE; BOBI; DELETEBI; REPLACEREPLACE; BOIt accomplishes this by changing the menu to include sensitive peripheries for the relevant commands.  Load the file and call (DEDITK) to start it up - the next call to DEDIT will exhibit the new menu.Non-feature:  Undoing these operations, or there uncompounded versions, works correctly, but displays BITMAP#xxx UNDONE in the prompt window.
