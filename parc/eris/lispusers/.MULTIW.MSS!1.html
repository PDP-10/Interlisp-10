@style(spacing 1)@make(manual)@flushright(C.D.Lane  1/83)@heading(MULTIW)@b(MULTIW.LSP) contains the basic functions necessary for a hierarchicalwindow environment.  The functions provide both the means to link windowsand the changes to the standard window functions to handle multiwindows ina reasonable way.  Only the minimal support is incorporated since it isunclear how multiwindows will be used in different settings.Windows that @i(belong) to other windows will move, close, shrink and openwhen their @i(super) window does.  A @i(super) window is not affectedby the window functions of its sub windows (but can be made to be).Sub windows can be moved, closed, shrunk, opened, and so forth as normalwindows.When buried, multiwindows bury as a group, retaining their relative layering, but going below unrelated windows.To get the full support for  multiwindows, (MULTIWADVICE) must beinvoked.  This function advises several standard window functions to resetthe window layers after they perform their operations.  Multiwindows canbe used @i(without) advice, but the windows will have to be explicitlyreset.  Currently the functions being advised are (BURYW CLEARW MOVEW OPENW SHRINKW).Where possible, functions on the windows property list were changed ratherthan advising the existing ones, to keepthe system as compatible as possible with any environment its used in.If @i(SuperWindow), or @i(SubWindowLst) are NIL in following functions,they are prompted for with \MULTIWPROMPT.@b&lt;MULTIW (@i{SuperWindow SubWindowLst})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@i(SubWindowLst) can be a list of windows or a window.MULTIW adds windows in @i(SubWindowLst) to @i(SuperWindow)'sSUBWINDOWLST propertyif it exits, creates it otherwise (WINDOWADDPROP). Also, @i(SuperWindow) getsadded to the SUPERWINDOWLST propertyof each element of the @i(SubWindowLst), providingpointers in both directions (currently, the multiwindow package does not usethe backward pointers, they are provided for the user's convienence).@i(Superwindow) also gets its window function (see \MULTIWNEWFNS)properties redefinedto the multiwindow versions.@b&lt;@u(WARNING:)&gt; Window structures @u(must) be DAGs (directed acyclic graphs),there should be no waya window can reach itself by following out the pointers to its subwindows.Recursive window structures will cause infinite looping of the windowfunctions.@b&lt;MULTIWFREE (@i{SuperWindow SubWindowLst})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@i(SubWindowLst) can be a list of windows, a single window, T or NIL.MULTIWFREE frees the links from @i{SuperWindow} to the windows in@i(SubWindowLst) as well as the pointers back.  If @i(SubWindowLst) is T,then @i(SuperWindow) is freed of all its subwindows (and they of it).@b&lt;MULTIWADVICE ()&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]MULTIWADVICE advises functions based on the @i(scripts) in \MULTIWADVISEDFNS. The function returns a list of the advised functionswhich should be saved if one wishes to UNADVISE the functions (which isrecommended before another call to (MULTIWADVICE)).@b&lt;MULTIWGRAPH (@i{SuperWindow DisplayWindow})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]MULTIWGRAPH graphs a window relation structure in @i(DisplayWindow)(which can be NIL).  Useful in debugging relationships between windows.  The GRAPHER package must be loaded to use this function.@b&lt;\MULTIWGRAPH (@i{NodeWindow})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]Function MULTIWGRAPH uses to recursively follow down the window links.@subheading(MultiWindow Window Functions)Most are functionally identical to the normal window functions except theyperform the proper task on all of the subwindows and reset the windowstructure.@b&lt;\MULTIWMOVEFN (@i{Window NewPosition})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@b&lt;\MULTIWCLOSEFN (@i{Window})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@b&lt;\MULTIWSHRINKFN (@i{Window})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@b&lt;\MULTIWEXPANDFN (@i{Window})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@b&lt;\MULTIWTOTOPFN (@i{Window})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@b&lt;\MULTIWBURYFN (@i{Window})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]@b&lt;\MULTIWPROMPT (@i{PromptString})&gt; @&gt;[@i(function)]Prints @i(PromptString) in PROMPTWINDOW and returns a (WHICHW (GETPOSITION))@b(@u{NOTE:}) A demonstration of multiwindows can be found in@b(MULTIW.DEMO).  The GRAPHER package should be loaded, as wellas @b(MULTIW.LSP).  The call (DEMO MULTIWDEMO) starts the demo.</pre>
