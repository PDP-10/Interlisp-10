IOWAITDAEMONWhen the INTERLISP system goes into an "I/O wait" after printing theprompt character, it is often useful to do some computations untilinput from the terminal actually occurs (e.g.  check for new mail,report the system load average, etc.).  IOWAITDAEMON accomplishesthis.  In essence, IOWAITDAEMON causes the system to go into aDISMISS/READP loop rather than an I/O wait.  Any forms on the globalvariable IOWAITDAEMONFORMS are EVALed; an integer should be returned(if not then 1 is used) which says to wait that number of minutesbefore the form should be EVALed again.Forms are checked every minute (actually the value of the globalvariable IOWAITEDAEMONINTERVAL in milleseconds) to see what should bere-evaled.  You may dynamically add or remove forms fromIOWAITDAEMONFORMS either before or after loading IOWAITDAEMON.
