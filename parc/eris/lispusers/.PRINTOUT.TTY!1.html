The new things are:	* PRINTPARA now uses pixel positioning when printing to displaystreams.	* Bitmaps are now incorporated as a printout form.  This new form	  is .BM &lt;before&gt; &lt;descent&gt; &lt;bitmap&gt; which is implemented by the	  function PRINTBM.  &lt;before&gt; is the amount to scroll up the	  displaystream before bitmap is displayed.  NIL means don't	  scroll, T means scroll the amount the bitmap extends above the	  top of the current line, a number means scroll that amount above	  the top of the current line. &lt;descent&gt; is how far below the current	  line to BITBLT the bitmap.  The window is scrolled up if there is	  not enough room.  The following line printed will be printed so	  it doesn't overlap the bitmap.  NIL means don't descend, a number	  means descend that amount.  &lt;bitmap&gt; is the bitmap to print.	  The displaystream is left at the same Y position it was before the	  BITBLT and advanced the width of the bitmap.  If the bitmap is	  too wide to fit a new line is generated.</pre>
