SHOWThis is a trivial file that adds the following facilities:It adds a LISPXMACRO SHOW (and lowercase show) that will pretty-printto the terminal the value of the preceding history event.  Itmay be given event-specification arguments like ?? and REDO to indicatean event other than the last one whose value is to be printed.The file also defines the function SHOW, which is used by theLISPXMACRO, and makes the function IT be equivalent to VALUEOF.Thus, IT as a variable is equivalent to (VALUEOF -1). (IT A B C)is equivalent to (VALUEOF A B C), but is easier to type.The value of the SHOW macro and function is the item that it prints.------This facility was designed by Beau Sheil and Ron Kaplan.
