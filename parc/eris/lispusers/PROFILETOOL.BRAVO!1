It accomplishes this by creating a specialized InspectorWindow for enumerating and changing variables, etc. of a package as described to the ProfileTool.  [It assumes the user is familiar with the use of InspectorWindows.]x6e12j\f6g4i11I147i16I92f7 1i65I1f6Usez18432x6e24j\f6bgA ProfileTool is created by calling the function PROFILETOOL with ProfileKeys and a title for the InspectorWindow.  ProfileKeys is a list of instances of the record PROFILEKEY.  A PROFILEKEY record has the following fields:  DESCRIPTOR, FETCHFN, REPLACEFN, HELPSTRING, and EXTRADATA.z18432x6e12j\f6g49f8 11f6 6i11I7i5I76f8 10f6 5f8 11f6 34f8 44f6 4f8 9f6DESCRIPTOR is usually an atom (although it can be a string) which gets printed as the "property name" in the InspectorWindow.z18432l6350x6e12j\f8g10f6FETCHFN is a function to be envoked to determine the "value" of the DESCRIPTOR.  If FETCHFN  is a litatom, then it will be applied (APPLY*) to the DESCRIPTOR and PROFILEKEYS.  If FETCHFN is NIL, then (GETTOPVAL DESCRIPTOR) will be used.z18432l6350x6e12j\f8g8f6 60f8 10f6 6f8 8f6 39f8 8f6 8f8 11f6 4f8 11f6 6f8 7f6 4f8 3f6 7f8 22f6REPLACEFN is a function to be envoked to "set" the value of the DESCRIPTOR.  If REPLACEFN is a litatom, then it will be applied to DESCRIPTOR and PROFILEKEYS (unless it is the atom DON'T, in which case there is no REPLACEFN).  It should determine a value, usually by asking the user, and return the new value.  If REPLACEFN is a list of litatoms, then that list will be taken as the list of all possible values for the DESCRIPTOR, a pop-up menu will be created of those items, and a SETTOPVAL will be envoked on the DESCRIPTOR and the value returned from MENU.  If REPLACEFN is NIL, then the behavior will be as if REPLACEFN was (T NIL)  i.e. the only possible values of DESCRIPTOR are T or NIL.  Whenever REPLACEFN is used, the new value will be redisplayed in the ProfileTool window, expanding it's width if necessary.z18432l6350x6e12j\f8g9f6 55f8 11f6 5f8 9f6 42f8 10f6 4f8 12f6 24f8 5f6 28f8 9f6 1f8 1f6 89f8 9f6 96f8 12f6 52f8 9f6 24f8 10f6 29f8 4f6 6f8 10f6 3f8 3f6 34f8 10f6 4f8 7f6 36f8 10f6 5f8 2f6 3f8 3f6 12f8 9f6HELPSTRING is a string to be printed out in the PROMPTWINDOW under certain conditions.  [Currently, HELPSTRING is not used since the conditions have not yet been determined, but is planned to be used in the future.]z18432l6350x6e12j\f8g10f6 38f8 13f6 27f7 1i125I1f6EXTRADATA is a place holder for any "package information" associated with the DESCRIPTOR.  Since PROFILEKEYS are passed to FETCHFN and REPLACEFN, a user of ProlfileTool can use this as he pleases (e.g. to cache information).z18432l6350x6e12j\f8g9f6 69f8 30f6 15f8 7f6 1f8 14f6 z18432x6e12j\f6gSome Examplesz18432x6e24j\f6bgIf a package has a global variable that should only have the values T or NIL, then the key in PROFILEKEYS can be just the value of (create PROFILEKEY DESCRIPTOR _ 'var).z18432x6e24j\f6g68f8 1f6 4f8 3f6 11i3I4f8 12f6 25f8 1b6B26i3I1f6If a package has a global variable that should only have the values FOO, FUM, or FIE, then the key should be the value of 	(create PROFILEKEY	DESCRITOR _ 'var 								REPLACEFN _ '(FOO FUM FIE)).z18432x6e24j\f6g68f8 9f6 4f8 5f6 36f8 3b7B24i4I36f6If a package wants to display a read-only item, e.g. the user's name, then the key should be the value of 	(create PROFILEKEY	DESCRIPTOR _ 'UserName 								FETCHFN _ (FUNCTION GETUSERNAME) 								REPLACEFN _ 'DON'T) where GETUSERNAME is defined to be (LAMBDA (D K) (USERNAME NIL T)).z18432x6e24j\f6g107f8 2b7B104f6 8f8 11f6 18f8 31f6Of course, the FETCHFN and REPLACEFN can be as complex as necessary.  ProfileTool has been designed to give maximum flexiblity, but simplifying the most typical cases  i.e. global variables with a fixed set of possible values.z18432x6e24j\f6g15f8 8f6 4f8 9f6z18432x6e12j\f6g x6\f6
