I am furnishing these programsto Xerox for distribution to users on an "as is" basis.  I will generallybe willing to fix bugs that might be found, but make no guarantees.GEV and GLISP both need to be compiled for speed.  In order to compileGEV, the procedure is:  1. Load GLISP  2. Load GEV.LSP  3. TCOMPL(GEV.LSP)One of the GEV functions will generate lots of GLISP error messages, butdon't let that bother you.  The GEV.DCOM file which results can then beused by itself.Larry, I am willing for both of these packages to be distributed onLISPUSERS.  GEV only works on D-machines; GLISP should work on allInterlisp systems.  However, I have found that most Interlisp systemson DEC-20's are not sufficiently up-to-date to accept the file packagecommands you put into my file.  Therefore, I recommend you get thefile   {SCORE}<CSD.NOVAK>GLISP.LSP  which has old-style file packagestuff kludged onto the end for distribution to Interlisp users ingeneral.  GEV doesn't currently do Records (due to my laziness), butI can put that in if somebody needs it.Cheers, Gordon-------Date: 16-Dec-82 14:58:47 PST (Thursday)From: Masinter at PARC-MAXCSubject: Re: G-Lisp for NCRIn-reply-to: CSD.NOVAK's message of 15 Dec 1982 1541-PSTTo: Gordon Novak <CSD.NOVAK at SU-SCORE>cc: Martin.eos, Moran.eos, Masinter, CSchmidt at SUMEX-AIMRick:If you would care to copy the files Gordon mentioned to  the <LISPUSERS> directory on PARC-MAXC, they will then be available to Interlisp-10 users.Gordon: I normally send out, without charge, updates to Interlisp-10 to people who write me requesting it. The files are also available over ARPANET. If you run across people who WANT announcements of Interlisp-10 updates and haven't been getting them, please let me know and I will add them to the distribution list.You can also send mail directly to InterlispSites^.PA@parc-maxc.If you want to make your system available to Interlisp-VAX users, you can send the offer to INTERLISP@ISIB; they make up distribution tapes and update-tapes for their (non-network) users.Larry----------------------------------------------------------------
