PQUOTE Documentation - Don Cohen 4/84 (DonC@ISIF)PQUOTE redefines the ' readmacro, installs it in all the system readtables,and defines a pretty print macro for QUOTE.  The main difference betweenthe old readmacro and the new one is that the old one required that thenext character not be a sepr.  The new one does not, i.e., (A ' B) nowreads as a list of two items rather than three.  The change is necessitatedby the fact that the print macro cannot guarantee that the quoted objectwill be printed on the same line as the '.Another change is that the READ' readmacro is now declared as ESC, i.e.,miscellaneous occurrences of ' will be printed as %'.  (This is really onlyneeded when they are the first character of an atom, but Interlisp doesn'trecognize this small optimization.)  This means that you can now savethings like (SELECTQ CHAR (%' 1) 0) - of course you have to type in the %to input it.
