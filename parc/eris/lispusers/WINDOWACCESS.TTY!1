                            WINDOWACCESSFile:	[Phylum]<LispUsers>WindowAccess.PressRevised:	February 2, 1983 by Martin YonkeThis file contains one record declaration which declares ACCESSFNSfor all the standard window properties.  This allows one to writecode using fetch and replace instead of WINDOWPROP function calls.Using CLOSEFN  as the example property, the following becomeequivalent:(fetch CLOSEFN of WINDOW)  = (WINDOWPROP WINDOW (QUOTE CLOSEFN))and(replace CLOSEFN of WINDOW with FOO) = (WINDOWPROP WINDOW (QUOTECLOSEFN)  FOO)This also has the advantage that you can now ask questions toMASTERSCOPE  about CLOSEFN as a field.
