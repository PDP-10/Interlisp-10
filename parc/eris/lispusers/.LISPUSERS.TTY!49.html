			LISPUSERS PACKAGES SUMMARY     The original source for this file is{ERIS}&lt;LISPUSERS&gt;LISPUSERS.TTY.     This file is a summary of all files on &lt;LISPUSERS&gt;, and is a gooddocument to read if you are unfamiliar with the many LISPUSERSpackages available to you.  The paragraphs below summarize eachLISPUSERS package or auxiliary file in 6 lines or less.     A similar library, &lt;LISP&gt;LIBRARY&gt;, is offered by XeroxLISPSUPPORT, and is documented by &lt;LISPCORE&gt;LIBRARY&gt;LISPLIBRARY.TTY.Contributors to LISPUSERS are encouraged to edit this file wheneverthey contribute or modify a package on &lt;LISPUSERS&gt;.  Rules: (1) Onlyedit entries you own--i.e.  you are the AUTHOR of the correspondingsource code.  (2) Stay within your 6 line limit. (3) Filealphabetically.			LISPUSERS PACKAGES SUMMARYACTIVEREGIONS	Package for specifying that certain regions of awindow be sensitive to button activity of the mouse.  Regions arehighlighted when mouse button is down and associated function for anactive region is invoked when mouse button is released.ANIMATE.  This small package contains functions for moving anon-rectangular bitmap smoothly around the screen, ways of using theseto get big cursors, and bitmaps for a large arrow and a hand to beused as large cursors.AREDIT	Tool for submitting, viewing, &amp; editing Lisp ARs (actionrequests/Interlisp bug reports) from within Interlisp.  Type (AR.FORM)to create a form for Getting, Putting, &amp; Submitting ARs.ARITHMAC	Arithmetic macros for use with Interlisp-10 and theDECL package for a variety of arithmetic functions (ADD1, QUOTIENT,RAND, etc.). Not useful (except for backward compatibility) forInterlisp-D.BIZGRAFIX	Pie &amp; bar chat, line graph creation.BLACKOUT	(Blackout text interval) makes a back window the sizeof the screen and bounces a square around on it, like DMT, etc. Goodfor servers. Text and interval default to "Type Key" and NIL (=forever) if not given.BROWSER Mastersope's SHOW PATHS output is displayed as a directedgraph showing calling hiarchy from a function.  Buttoning a node ofthe graph allows user to print, edit, or DESCRIBE the function.BLTDEMO	Implements Smalltalk graphics demo in Interlisp.  Spinningstar, bouncing ring &amp; box.  Call: (BOUNCE X Y) where X and Y arevelocities defaulting to 3.  Box shows whatever is near cursor.Interseting recursive effects can be seen if you move the cursor nearthe box.BQUOTE	Backquote punctuation.  Enables backquote (character 96) andcommas to be used to construct lists similar to CLISP's &lt;, !, !!, and&gt; operators only better.  Readmacros and prettyprintmacros makebackquote easy to use.  Also offers PQUOTE's functionality.CALENDAR A calendar/appointment-reminder program.  Displays any year,month or day.  Messages alert you at predetermined time, or canoptionally be mailed (via Lafite) to any desired recipients.  CALL:(CALENDAR).CHUNK-MENU	Permits the creation and use of pop-up menus for longlists of items.  User sees one "chunk" of the list at a time.  Menuitems at top and bottom allow user to move forward and backward toother chunks.COLORUTILITIES	Functions to aid color programming.  Allows for colorwindows, color menus (pop-up and active), and interactive color bitmapediting.  Must have COLOR.DCOM and COLORPATCH.DCOM loaded first.COMHACK Advises CLISPIF and CLISPFOR to allow comments anywhere in ifsand for loops.  Can be used to provide similar facility for other CLISPwords.CROCK 	Function for creating and manipulating an analog face clock.Menu allows user to change style of clock.  Call: (CROCK REGION).DATETIME	Date/Time Parser.  Various types of date/times:datetime, multipledatetimes, duration, qualifieddatetime.  Parser andfunctions for manipulating date/times.DEDITK Adds single button method for combining the most frequentlycombined pairs of BI/BO and BEFORE/AFTER/DELETE/REPLACE in DEDIT -Load and call (DEDITK).DPRESS	Disassemble PRESS.  Functions to disassemble PRESS files.Used by PRESSTOIP.DRAWFILE	Two functions for converting DRAW-format files(produced by Alto DRAW program) to and from lisp figuredata-structures.  Supports spline curves, text, and color.DWIMLOAD	Package does what (SETQ DWIMLOADFNSFLG T) does butfaster.  It doesn't use LOADFNS and so doesn't need to do UPDATEFILES,etc.EDITBITMAP	Interface for manipulating bitmaps.  Includes accessto Interlisp-D EDITBM as well as shifting, rotation, inverting,interchanging black and white, and adding a border.  Also works oncursors.EDITFONT	Gives the user functions for creating and edittingDISPLAY fonts which can be read and written as STRIKE font files.Includes: EDITFONT, BLANKFONTCREATE, READSTRIKEFONTFILE, andWRITESTRIKEFONTFILE.EDITHIST	An extension to Interlisp's file package thatpermanently preserves the history of new versions of files.  Everytime a file is remade, a new entry containing DATE, AUTHOR, FILE,CHANGES, &amp; COMMENTS info is added.EDITMACROS Some useful (tty-based) editor macros; includes COPY and SWITCH with syntax like basic MOVE command, and IFY for converting CONDs into clisp's "if".EMACS	A very small subset of EMACS (text editor developed at MIT)built on top of TEDIT.  Will probably grow into greater completionwhen the demise of MAXC becomes imminent.  Call: (EMACS FILE).EMACSUSER	Package defines a variety of functions amenable tocreating a programming environment where the user does his coding inEMACS (the MACLISP/EMACS style of coding versus the Interlisp filepackage style of coding).  Loads BQUOTE &amp; SETF.EXEC	This small package allows the user to create extra EXEC windowsin which to do EVALQTing.  A new EXEC window may be created in eitherof two ways.  The user may either do (EXEC) or button the EXEC menuitem added to the background menu.EXECFNS Package emulates TOPS-20-style "logical names".  Instead oftypeing {RED}&lt;FOODIRECTORY&gt; you can use the DEF lispxmacro to defineFOO: as {RED}&lt;FOODIRECTORY&gt;.  Lispxmacros TY, CONN &amp; KD and fnsINFILE, OUTFILE, INFILEP, OUTFILEP, &amp; COPYFILE are modified/advised toexpand logical names.  The lispxmacro DEF? can be used to see whatlogical defs are currently defined.FACEINVADER	A game.  The object of the game is to shoot thebouncing 'face' before it overruns your base.  Call: (FIINSTRUCTIONS?).FASTLOAD	Function to load a file without file package overheador changes to history list.  Otherwise like (LOAD FILE T)--olddefinitons are simply overwritten.  Call: (FASTLOAD FILE).FASTNAMEFIELD	Code which speeds up UNPACKFILENAME, FILECOMS,NAMEFIELD, and FILENAMEFIELD at the expense of some space.  Valuesfrom these fns are stored in a hash table so that calls with old argscost only a table lookup.FILEINDEX	Functions makes an index file (default is to the lineprinter).  The inex file will have a table of contents which will listall the functions in alphabetical order and a sequence number of wherethat function is in the files.  Call: (FILEINDEX FILELST OUTPUTFILE).FONTN 	Contains font definitions for fonts FONT1, FONT2, etc., whichare utilized by the printout for commands of the form .FONT 1, .FONT2, etc.GEV	GEV display editor/inspector.  Related to GLISP (somehow).GEVDEMO	Demo file for GEV.GLISP	Compiler for GLISP, object oriented form of lisp.GRCALLS	Allows fast graphing of the calling hiarchy of bothinterpreted and compiled code, whether or not the source code isavailable, thus allowing examination of both user and system functions.GRAPHER	Functions and an interface for laying out, displaying andeditting graphs.  Supports node labels, directed and undirectedgraphs, and straight line links.HASHFILE	Package is intended to provide a mechanism to dump anylisp data structure onto premanent storage with no dependency on theusual PRINT/READ mechanism.  Recursive structures, shared pointerstructures, and user datatypes handled.HEADLINE	Three functions for manipulating windows containingheadlines: HEADLINE, BILLBOARD, and CLOSEHEADLINES.  Useful fortitling a screen image or leaving message on screen while away.HISTMENU	Provides simple way to access Interlisp history listusing menu.  REDO, UNDO, FIX, and ?? selected items.  Call:(HistoryMenu histMenuLength histMenuPosition).ICON	Cedar icon windows for shrinking windows.  Icons: Document,FileCabinet, Envelope, People, Map, Printer, Calendar, QuestionMark,TV, BriefCase, ToolBox, Envelopes, Person, NotePad, Squirrel, MailBox,Lecturer, Scroll.IGNORECHAR 	Permits characters to be defined in a read table as"ignorable"--neither delimiting atoms, nor appearing inside them.Example: If "#" has syntax class IGNORE, then (CO#NS 'A 'B) returns (A. B). Not verified to work in Interlisp-D.IMAGEDEMO	Color graphics demo.  Call: (IMAGEDEMO).IMTEDIT	Is a program built on IMTRAN that translates IM format filesto formatted Tedit text streams.IMTRAN	Is the original program LISPSUPPORT uses for translating fromIM format to TEX source files (not too useful for most people).  SeeIMTEDIT.INMENU Functions to support interactive menus for program interaction.Similar to the standard pop-up menus except that arguments arecompatible with INTTY and does not lock out other processes.JARGON ... N random broken definitions from the imfamous hacker's dictionary, snarfed from MIT-AI.  (The globalvar JARGON.FILE.LOCATION points to the database file.)  Starts up on load, or type (JARGON.READ)KAL	Kaleidoscope demo.  Call: (KAL).  Control with middle button menu.LABEL	Implements Lisp 1.5 LABEL construct.  Example: (name a b)appearing in the forms of (LABEL name args . forms) will recursivelyapply the function specified by the LABEL.LANDPRESS	Allows landscape printing of ASCII text files on pressprinters (e.g., Dovers).  Function LANDPRESS produces same product asMAKEPRESS, only printed sideways on the page allowing for wideroutput.LCROCK 	Puts a digital/analog clock in the unused area of the LOGOW.       (START.LCROCK &lt;myLogo&gt; &lt;Position&gt;) starts it up.  &lt;myLogo&gt;, if non-NIL, will replace the "Interlisp-D" logo; and &lt;Position&gt;, if non-NIL, will be the lower-left corner (NIL means to use the position of the existing logo window).  The glovalvarCROCKUPDATERATE.MS is the number of milliseconds between automatic updates.LOADFILES	Function to help in loading groups of files.  Call:(LOADFILES DIR FILES EXT LDFLG PRINTFLG).  Value of LOADFILES is alist of the files actually loaded.LSET	List SETs.  Functions for operating on sets implemented aslists.  Contains functions for union, intersection, and subtraction.Functions to unify an element with a list, setify a list, and test ifa list is a subset of another list are also included.LUPINE	 implementation of Cedar Remote Procedure Call generator.MACWINDOW	Advises SHRINKW and EXPANDW to produce a zoomingeffect by showing the outline of their window arguments as they shrinkor grow.MAILOPS 	Functions for poking into and "scavenging"Laurel/Lafite/...  mail files.  See MAILOPS.tty.MAKEGRAPH	Package built on GRAPHER which helps user creategraphs by walking through them.  Each point in the walk (node in thegraph) is characterized by a datum/state pair.  Motion is defined by astate transition function and checking whether a node has already beenvisited.  Do (MAKE.GRAPH.EXAMPLE) for an example.MATHFNS	Higher mathematical functions not already provided byInterlisp.  Includes additional trigonometric functions, logarithmicfunctions, hyperbolic functions, mathematical constants, and macrosand functions for complex arithmetic.MSGLAFITE	Converts a MSG mail file (e.g., on MAXC or SU-BBOARDS)to a Lafite readable mail file.  Call: (ConvertMsgToLafite MsgFileLafiteFile)MOUSECONFIRM	Contains function and cursor definition to be used forconfirming potentially dangerous or computationally expensive menuselections.  Replaces cursor with little mouse image and waits forconfirming click.  Call: (MOUSECONFIRM PROMPTSTRING).MULTIFILEINDEX	Like SINGLEFILEINDEX, but also indexes records,parameters, etc.  Works across several files and is userful forindexing a whole "system" of files. [May be superseded by the "new"SINGLEFILEINDEX of mid-1984]MULTIMENU	Package which allows user to create a number of menusor windows to be associated with a main window.  Example application:an editor whose commands (menu driven) are a function of the itemselected in the editor window.  Contextually inappropriate menusdisappear and appropriate menus are highlighted.MULTIW	Contains functions necessary for a hiarchical windowenvironment.  Windows that belong to other windows will move, close,shrink, and open when their super window does.MULTIW-DEMO	Demos MULTIW package.NOTEPAD	Allows user to do artwork at bitmap level in NOTEPAD windows.Trajectories: sketch, line, circle, ellipse, open curve, closed curve.Objects/editting: text, are of screen, shade rectangle, fill, editarea.  Style: brush, use mask, mask, use grid, grid, use symmetry,point of symmetry, text font, shade.NOTEPAD-CORESTYLES	Used by NOTEPAD.NQUEENS	Solves N Queens problem.  How to place N queens on a chessboard so that they don't attack each other.  Graphics demo.  Call:(NQUEENS N).ODOMETER	Functions for creating and manipulating a horizontalsequence of small windows containing digits resembling a car'sodometer (mileage gauge).  Digits scroll into place as if digit wheelis turning.  Call: (ODOCREATE #DIGITS FONT PLACE) where #DIGITS is thenumber of digit wheels desired.  Fns: ODOCLOSE, ODOCREATE, ODODEC,ODOINC, ODOOPEN, ODOPUT, ODOSET, &amp; ODOVAL.PACMAN  Game.  Runs in b/w or color.  CALL: (PACMAN).PAGEFULLCTRL	Useful for controlling the scrolling behaviour of theTTYDISPLAYSTREAM window.  PAGEFULLFN is advised to continue scrolling(rather than inverting the window and waiting for a space to be typed)unless the CTRL key is held down.PAGEHOLD	Redefines the default PAGEFULLFN, and provides hooks formaking individual non-TTYDISPLAYSTREAM windows scrollable.  Scrolling is "held" for up to PAGE.WAIT.SECS seconds, during which time an attached"button" on the window softly flashes, and then the hold is"released".  Holding down either SHIFT key will continue the "hold" (i.e., prevent "release"); letting up on either SHIFT key will "release" the "hold".PATCHUP Facilitates making patch files when there is multiuserinteraction on a system.  Designed to allow dumping of a patch filecontaining changes from a number of files.PEANO	Peano curves graphics demo.  CALL: (PEANODEMO LEVEL SCALE).PERFORMTRAN	Adds CLISP word perform to record package.  Rumored tobe described in Interlisp Reference Manual (GKW).PERMSTATUS	Function used in conjunction with WHENCLOSE package tomake a file "permanently" open in the sense that as much of its statusas possible will be restored when a sysout is resumed.  Described inInterlisp Reference Manual.PLAY	Offers Interlisp-D users a disciplined way to play simplemusical melodies on Xerox 1108 machines.  (PLAY.DEMO) demos the PLAYpackage.  Main functions: PLAY.NOTES, PLAY.MELODY, PLAY.KEYBOARD.PRESSTOIP	PRESS TO InterPress.  Converts PRESS files toINTERPRESS files.  Call: (PRESS.TO.IP PRESSFILE IPFILE).PRINTL	Function which prints circular list structures.  Described inInterlisp Reference Manual.PROFILETOOL	Creates a specialized InspectorWindow for enumeratingand changing variables, etc.  Useful for creating a graphicalinterface to attributes of any "package" written in Interlisp.PROMPTREMINDERS 	User can be periodically reminded of important things by messages which are aggressively winked and flashed in awindow (or on primary output for non-D machines).  May supersede theREMIND package;  See PROMPTREMINDERS.tty/.press for fuller documentation.QIX ... Makes "floating fish" (like the Qix video game) that run around inthe window.  (QIX.PLAY n) makes N Qix in a screen sized window.(QIX.GROW dismissflg) sets up one Qix in (WHICHW).  Dismissflg tells whetherthe new process will give up its time slice or not (T = do dismiss everycycle).  Qixs follow the window border and thus reshaping the windowcan be amusing.READACFONTFILE	Make FONTDESCRIPTORS from *.ac font files (eg. Starfont files)REDUCE		Old partial implementation of the REDUCE algebraicmanipulation system, including differentiation etc.REMEVALCLIENT	"Client" side of an EVALSERVER implemented using RPC.REMEVALSERVER	"Server" side of an EVALSERVER implemented using RPC.REMIND	Facility for scheduling LISP events to take place at aspecified later time.  Reminders are stored on REMINDERS.LISP onuser's directory and an entry on AFTERSYSOUTFORMS causes them to beloaded via LOADREMINDERS which may also be put in user's init file.[See note on PROMPTREMINDERS above]RPC	Remote Procedure Calls.  Implements Cedar RPC transportmechanism allowing Interlisp-D to export services to or importservices from remote machines.SAMPLER	Graphics demo ("from Upstate New York").SETF	SET Field.  MACLISP SETF-style record accessing.  E.g.,(r.f d) =&gt; (fetch (r f) of d) &amp; (setf (r.f d) v) =&gt; (replace (r f) of d with v).  Less verbose than CLISP fetch &amp; replace,but without the drawbacks of packing record accesses into atoms aswith CLISP infixes ":" and ".".SHOW	Adds a LISPXMACRO SHOW that will prettyprint value ofpreceding history events with syntax similar to ?? and REDO.  Alsodefines functions SHOW and IT.SIGNAL	CEDAR/MESA-like signal mechanism.  Allows signals to beraised, caught, examined, resumed, or exited.SIMPLEFNS	Some simple functions.  Fns: COMBINATIONS, DKILL,DKILLQ, FILE, FIRSTPART, IFF, KILL, LEAVES, SEARCH, SINGLES,STRINGSUBST, SUPSETP, UNATTACH.SIMPLIFY	Tools for symbolic simplification of Lisp forms.SKIPTRAILER	A trivial package that modifies the FILERDTBL so thatBravo trailers (i.e. sequences between &uarr;z and carrieage-return) willbe ignored.SNAPSCROLL ... Advises snapw so that snapshot windows are scollable when reshaped.  This is very useful for snapping large lists and reading through them in smaller screen spaces. (See SNAPSCROLL.TED)SOLITAIRE	The card game Solitaire (graphics demo).  Call:(SOLO).SPACEWINDOW	Puts a small "Space Allocation" window on screen.Shows a bar-chart of the amounts of the four types of memory spacethat have been allocated (fixed data, variable data, atoms, pnames).Display is updated every 60 seconds.SPY	Is a tool that helps you find out where your program isspending its time. SPY gathers statistics by periodically interruptingthe running program, and looking back on the stack. SPY then willdisplay the timing information graphically, using the GRAPHER package.STOCKICONS	Use with ICONW.  A collection of stock icon windowssuitable for use with ICONW.STYLESHEET	Package which allows user to create a block of menuswhich pop up all at once and don't go away until the user has dealtwith all the menus in the block and indicated that he is done.SYSTAT	Redefines the CONTROL-T interrupt channel to put up a graphicdisplay instead of the usual type out.  Leftbuttoning SYSTAT.WINDOWdoes an immediate Update.  Middlebuttoning SYSTAT.WINDOW gives userchoice among Quickly mode, Slowly mode, Updating, Deactivating, andReactivating.TESTPAT	Test pattern(?).  Doesn't work.TMENU	Provides: (1) Interactive menus intended for reducing typing.Selected menu items are inserted into the TTY inpu buffer.  (2)Windowshades that make windows "roll up" when not in use.  (3) Twofunctions for managing PROMPTWINDOW.TRACEIN	Facility for very low level tracing/stepping.  Options: step,evaluate, finish, trace, prettyprint form, prettyprint value, retry,exit with value to be returned, break.  Evalhook and watch modes ofoperation.TRAJECTORY-FOLLOWER	Provides a function which causes a snake tocrawl along a trajectory.  Trajectory is specified by a set of KNOTSand a CLOSED flag.TSET	Transor package.  LISP-toISP translator intended to help theuser who has a program coded in one dialect of LISP and wishes tocarry it over to another.  Described in Interlisp Reference Manual.TTY	Simple set of functions, including prompted read, forinteracting with the TTY.  Easy to create programs that respond to"commands" or sequenced entry with a varied amount of prompting forinput.TTYIO 	Selective input fns: ASKFLE, ASKFN, ASKINT, ASKITEM, ASKITEMS,ASKRL, ASKYN.TWOD	A two-d graphics package.  Rather Siggraph-esque.TXDT	Collection of Interlisp functions designed for those who wishto build text editors in Interlisp.  Inserting, deleting, searchingand manipulating text in buffers.  Undoable modifications.  Provisionsfor fonts.WAM ... WindowActionMenu.  Attaches a menu to the side of a window which iconically represents various actions that can be taken on the target window.  (See WAM.TED)WINDOWACCESS	Contains ACCESSFNS for all the standard windowproperties, allowing user to write code using fetch and replaceinstead of WINDOWPROP function calls.</pre>
