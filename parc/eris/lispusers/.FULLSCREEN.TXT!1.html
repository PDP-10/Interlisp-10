						The FullScreen PackageThis package allows an entire screen's image to be printed on an Interpress printer.  Call the function MAKEPAGE (with no arguments) and then EMPRESSs the resulting file ({CORE}SCRATCH.IP).The printer will not be able to print images which contain large blocks of uninterrupted background.  If the printer software generates a "Plate Too Complicated; Too Much Marker Space" error, 'dummy' windows should be added to the screen.</pre>
