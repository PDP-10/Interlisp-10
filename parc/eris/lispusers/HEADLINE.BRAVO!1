Phrase is any Lisp object. Font defines a font as per FONTCREATE (eg. (TIMESROMAN 18 BOLD) ); if NIL, TimesromanD 36 is used. Position is a position giving the reference point for placing the window; if NIL, the user is given a chance to position the window with MOVEW. If Postion is given, Alignment gives the alignment of the window with respect to Position as (xalignment . yalignment) where xalignment is one of LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT and yalignment is one of BOTTOM, CENTER, or TOP; for convenience, if Position is CENTER then it is taken to mean (CENTER . CENTER), etc.x4e11j\31u6U17u4U13u8U16u9U56u6U21u4U95u8U139u7U11u9U51u8UBILLBOARD ( TITLES ALIGNMENT SEPARATION POSITION )x4e18j\b50BCreates a set of vertically arranged headline windows.
