                                                                  C.D.Lane 1/83                                    MULTIW  MULTIW.LSP  contains  the basic functions necessary for a hierarchical windowenvironment.  The functions provide both the means  to  link  windows  and  thechanges to the standard window functions to handle multiwindows in a reasonableway.    Only  the  minimal  support  is  incorporated  since  it is unclear howmultiwindows will be used in different settings.  Windows that belong to other windows will move, close, shrink and  open  whentheir  super  window  does.    A  super  window  is  not affected by the windowfunctions of its sub windows (but can be made to  be).    Sub  windows  can  bemoved,  closed,  shrunk,  opened, and so forth as normal windows.  When buried,multiwindows bury as a group, retaining  their  relative  layering,  but  goingbelow unrelated windows.  To  get  the  full  support for multiwindows, (MULTIWADVICE) must be invoked.This function advises several standard window functions  to  reset  the  windowlayers  after  they perform their operations.  Multiwindows can be used withoutadvice, but the windows will have  to  be  explicitly  reset.    Currently  thefunctions  being  advised  are  (BURYW  CLEARW  MOVEW  OPENW  SHRINKW).   Wherepossible, functions on the windows  property  list  were  changed  rather  thanadvising  the  existing ones, to keep the system as compatible as possible withany environment its used in.  If SuperWindow, or SubWindowLst are NIL  in  following  functions,  they  areprompted for with \MULTIWPROMPT.  MULTIW (SuperWindow SubWindowLst)                                  [function]  SubWindowLst  can  be  a list of windows or a window.  MULTIW adds windows inSubWindowLst to SuperWindow's SUBWINDOWLST property if  it  exits,  creates  itotherwise  (WINDOWADDPROP).  Also, SuperWindow gets added to the SUPERWINDOWLSTproperty of each element  of  the  SubWindowLst,  providing  pointers  in  bothdirections  (currently,  the  multiwindow  package  does  not  use the backwardpointers, they are provided for the user's convienence).  Superwindow also getsits window function (see \MULTIWNEWFNS) properties redefined to the multiwindowversions.  WARNING: Window structures must be  DAGs  (directed  acyclic  graphs),  thereshould be no way a window can reach itself by following out the pointers to itssubwindows.    Recursive  window  structures will cause infinite looping of thewindow functions.  MULTIWFREE (SuperWindow SubWindowLst)                              [function]  SubWindowLst can be a list of windows, a single window, T or NIL.  MULTIWFREEfrees the links from SuperWindow to the windows in SubWindowLst as well as  thepointers  back.    If  SubWindowLst  is T, then SuperWindow is freed of all itssubwindows (and they of it).  MULTIWADVICE ()                                                    [function]  MULTIWADVICE advises functions based on the scripts in \MULTIWADVISEDFNS. Thefunction returns a list of the advised functions which should be saved  if  onewishes  to  UNADVISE the functions (which is recommended before another call to(MULTIWADVICE)).  MULTIWGRAPH (SuperWindow DisplayWindow)                            [function]  MULTIWGRAPH graphs a window relation structure in DisplayWindow (which can beNIL).  Useful in debugging relationships between windows.  The GRAPHER  packagemust be loaded to use this function.  \MULTIWGRAPH (NodeWindow)                                          [function]  Function MULTIWGRAPH uses to recursively follow down the window links.MultiWindow Window Functions  Most  are  functionally  identical to the normal window functions except theyperform the proper  task  on  all  of  the  subwindows  and  reset  the  windowstructure.  \MULTIWMOVEFN (Window NewPosition)                                 [function]  \MULTIWCLOSEFN (Window)                                            [function]  \MULTIWSHRINKFN (Window)                                           [function]  \MULTIWEXPANDFN (Window)                                           [function]  \MULTIWTOTOPFN (Window)                                            [function]  \MULTIWBURYFN (Window)                                             [function]  \MULTIWPROMPT (PromptString)                                       [function]  Prints PromptString in PROMPTWINDOW and returns a (WHICHW (GETPOSITION))  NOTE:  A  demonstration  of  multiwindows  can  be found in MULTIW.DEMO.  TheGRAPHER package should be loaded, as  well  as  MULTIW.LSP.    The  call  (DEMOMULTIWDEMO) starts the demo.</pre>
