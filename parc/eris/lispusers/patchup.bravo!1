LispUsers Package  PATCHUP	e12c(635)\f5bDanny Bobrowe12c\f5b7 November 1982e12c\f5bPATCHUP is a LISPUSERS package which facilitates multiuser interaction on a system.  It is designed to allow dumping of a patch file containing changes from a number of files.  One calls:e12j(PatchUp filesOrEditFlg patchFileName)l4269e12j\bIf filesOrEditFlg = a list of file names, then changes which have been made to items on those files will be dumped on patchFileName.  Also included will be any changes that have not been associated with any file.e12jIf filesOrEditFlg=T, then a COMS list of all changes in the system will be computed, and the user will be left in the editor editing this COMS list.  Upon exiting from the editor, the revised COMS list will be used for dumping.e12jIf patchFileName is not given, then a file name of the form	<date>-<userName>.PATCHis used.  For example,	(PatchUp LOOPSFILES)could dump all changes made to items on LOOPSFILES to a file named	9-NOV-82-BOBROW.PATCHe12j
