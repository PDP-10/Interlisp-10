				CROCK      By Kelly Roach.  Last revised 25-Feb-84.  CROCK sets up an analogface clock in the user's environment.  To use, LOAD&lt;LISPUSERS&gt;CROCK.DCOM and call (CROCK).  CROCK requires thatPROCESSWORLD be running (automatic in Fugue or later).  Bugs andcomments can be sent to ROACH.PA.     (1) CROCK. Function CROCK has the form	(CROCK REGION)The first invocation creates a clock window, CROCKWINDOW, occupyingREGION with style CROCK.DEFAULT.STYLE.  If REGION is left NIL, aregion will be prompted for.  Subsequent invocations useCROCKWINDOW.  Only one clock window may exist at any given time.The clock is updated once a minute.     (2) STYLE. The clock's style is maintained as a property list andcan be found by (WINDOWPROP CROCKWINDOW 'STYLE). There are fourindependent boolean properties which the user may control: HANDS (thehands of the clock), TIMES (time digits printed where the hands end),RINGS (rings on the clock face), and NUMBERS (12 numbers around theoutside of the clock face).  The style first used will beCROCK.DEFAULT.STYLE (bound to '(HANDS T TIMES NIL RINGS NIL NUMBERS T)when &lt;LISPUSERS&gt;CROCK is first loaded).     (3) CROCK.ALARM AND CROCK.TUNE.  The user can set CROCK's alarmvia	(CROCK.ALARM DATESTRING)where DATESTRING is any arg acceptable to Interlisp's IDATE (such asthe date CROCK prints in CROCKWINDOW).  CROCK will act appropriatelywhen time reaches DATESTRING.  Dandelion users can set globalCROCK.TUNE to a tune to be played by Interlisp's PLAYTUNE when CROCK'salarm acts.     (4) RECOMMENDED USAGE.  The simplest way to call CROCKfrom your init file or other function is to set up your CROCK globals,then call CROCK:	(SETQ CROCK.DEFAULT.STYLE &lt;style&gt;)	(SETQ CROCK.TUNE &lt;tune&gt;)	(CROCK &lt;region&gt;)You supply &lt;style&gt;, &lt;tune&gt;, and &lt;region&gt;.          (5) LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.  Buttoning CROCKWINDOW with the leftmouse button requests immediate update of the clock.  (Of course, itmay take a while for the process scheduler to get to it.)     (6) MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON.  Buttoning CROCKWINDOW with the middlemouse button presents a menu of commands for modifying the clock'sstyle.  Menu item SHOW.STYLE prints the clock's style.     (7) RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.  Buttoning C ROCKWINDOW with the leftmouse button presents the usual window menu.  RESHAPEing theCROCKWINDOW causes the clock to change its size to fit the new windowregion.  CLOSEing the CROCKWINDOW deletes the clock process.</pre>
