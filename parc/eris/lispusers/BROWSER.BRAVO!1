It loads <LISPUSERS>GRAPHER.  The Browser calls LAYOUTFOREST to generate a graph showing the calling hierarchy.  The format is controled by the two variables BROWSERFORMAT and BROWSERBOXING (which are set intially to display horizontally and to box functions that occur more than once in the graph).  The graph is then displayed using SHOWGRAPH.  In general, the Browser creates a new window for each SHOW PATHS command, but will reuse a window if that window has an earlier instance of the same SHOW PATHS command displayed in it.  The windows can be reshaped and scrolled with the normal window menu commands.  e20j\f8 18f0 14f8 10f0 101f8 18f0 21f8 12f0 98f8 13f0 5f8 13f0 146f8 9f0 57f8 10f0 85f8 10f0The windows are "active" in that nodes in the graph (i.e., functions) can be selected for printing or editting using the mouse.  The letting up on the red button causes the nearest function to be pretty printed in the Browser's printout window.  Selecting the same function again will describe the function, using the Masterscope DESCRIBE command, in the Browser's describe window.  Selecting a function with the yellow button will call the display editor on it.  The graph is not updated automatically when one returns from the editor; the user must give the SHOW PATHS command over if desired.   e20j\330f8 8f0 222f8 10f0The Browser modification to Masterscope can be undone by calling (BROWSER NIL).  This restores the teletype-oriented output of SHOW PATHS.  (BROWSER T) turns the Browser back on.e20j\65f8 13f0 49f8 4f0 1f8 5f0 3f8 11f0
