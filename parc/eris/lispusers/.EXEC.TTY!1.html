				EXEC     By Kelly Roach.  Last revised 16-Jan-84.     This small package allows the user to create extra EXEC windowsin which to do EVALQTing.  A new EXEC window may be created in eitherof two ways.  The user may either do (EXEC) or button the EXEC menuitem added to the background menu.  Typing (EXEC.QUIT) into an EXECwindow will close the window (function EXEC.QUIT also takes a WINDOWargument and can be used as a CLOSEFN window property).     Comments or bugs may be sent to ROACH.PA.</pre>
