Following is the scenario we would like to create while giving the demo, relevant portions of the documentation for the major sections of the demo, and an example script.  The example script should be followed closely unless the demonstrator is EXTREMELY familiar with the workings of the following systems. Continually emphasize the following (for the purpose of pointing out that this is more than your typical data processor) =>	-Relationship of text processing to the integrated environment of Interlisp-D	-Ability to  write AI programs to perform text manipulations2.  DOCUMENTATION FOR DEMO FEATURES=>A)  LAFITEThe Interisp Mail SystemLafite is the Interlisp system for reading and sending mail.  Lafite retrieves inbound mail from the user's inboxes on one or  more mail servers.  Mail is retrieved into one or more mail folders, which can be any Interlisp-accessible file.There are three major types of windows used by Lafite: the Status window; Browser windows, which are views of particular mail folders; and Message composition windows.Lafite Status WindowThe Lafite Status Window contains a small, fixed menu and a region for Lafite status information.  While Lafite is in operation, it runs a background process-LAFITEMAILWATCH-that polls the user's inboxes periodically and reports in the status region if there is new mail.  Clicking the status region causes the background process to wake up and report status immediately, instead of waiting its normal interval.  The commands in this window's menu are as follows:	BROWSE Pops up a menu of the mail folders that Lafite is aware that you have.  Selecting  'Another Folder'prompts you for a folder name in the prompt window.  After a folder is selected,a browser window onto that mail folder is opened.	SEND MAIL Brings up an Interlisp text editor window on a message form.  The form is a canonical 'empty message' if Send Mail is  selected with the left button.  If Send Mail is selected with the middle button, a menu is presented with the following choices:	Standard Form	Last Message	Lisp Report	Lafite Report	Private Form	QUIT Stops Lafite, closes all browser windows and updates the associated mail folders.Browser WindowsA browser window is a view onto a mail folder.  The main part of the window displays the table of contents, a one-line summary of each message.  This window is scrollable in both directions.  Above the table of contents is a horizontal menu (called the browser menu), containing commands specific to the mail folder associated with the browse window.  Above the menu is a prompt window, in which various status information related to the browser is printed, and where some information is prompted for.The commands in the browser menu are as follows:	DISPLAY: displays the selected message.	DELETE: deletes the selected messages.	UNDELETE: undeletes the selected messages.	ANSWER: constructs a Message Composition Window Containing an answer template for the current message.	FORWARD: similar to Answer but the message form is a forward template for the currently selected messages.	HARDCOPY: prints the selected messges on your local printing device.	MOVE TO: pops up a menu of known mail folders and moves the selected messages to the chosen folder.	UPDATE: the changes that you make to your mail folder (deletions, changes of message marks, etc.) are not actually transmitted to the physical amil file until you perform the Update command.	GET MAIL: brings new mail into the folder that this browser is viewing.Message Composition WindowsOn top of the text editor window is a hoizontal menu for telling Lafite what to do with the message being created in the text editor window.  When one has transformed the text to the desired message, select one of the following menu items:	DELIVER- sends your message.	SAVE FORM- asks you for a file name on which to save this message for later use.	ABORT- closes the window and does nothing with the message.************************************************************************************************************B)  THE TEDIT TEXT EDITORTEdit is a window-based, modeless text editor, capable of handling fonts and some rudimentary formatting. Text is selected with the mouse, and all editor operations act on the current selection.The text is displayed in an editting window, and may be edited there.The TEdit option in the background menu  opens an empty editing window; you may either type in the text you want or use the PUT menu  option to bring in a file.***SELECTING TEXT***TEdit works by operating on selected pieces of text. Selected text is highlighted in some way, and may have a caret flashing at one end.  Insertions go wherethe caret is; deletion and other operations are applied to  currently selected text.Text is selected using the mouse.  There are 2 regions within an edit window; the area containing the text and a line bar just inside the left edge of the window.  While the mouse is inside of the text region,the cursor is the nomal up-and-left pointing arrow. When the cursor moves into the line bar, it changes to the up-and-right pointing arrow.  Which region the mouse is in determines what kind of selection happens.***EDITING OPERATIONS***Inserting text: Except for command characters, whatever is typed on the keyboard gets inserted where the caret is.Deleting Text: Hitting the DEL key causes the currently selected text to be deleted.Copying text: Hitting Shift-selecting with the mouse causes copying to the position of the caret.The command menu =>You can get command menus by moving into the edit window's title region and hitting the RIGHT or MIDDLE mouse buttons.  RIGHT gets the usual menu of window commands; MIDDLE gets a menu of editor commands:	PUT:  causes an updated version of the file to be written.  TEdit will ask you for a filename, offering the existing name as the default.	GET:  Lets you read in a new file to edit.  You'll be asked for a  filename in the prompt window.	INCLUDE:  Lets you copy the contents of  a  file into  the edit window, inserting it where the caret is.  TEdit  will ask you for a filename in its prompt window.	EXPANDED MENU:  Opens a large menu that has three parts: A TEdit operations section, a character looks menu, and a paragraph looks menu.  This expanded menu has fill-in blanks for some fields and on-off-neutral buttons to control character properties like BOLDNESS.***EXPANDED MENU***Selecting the item "Expanded menu" from TEdit's title-bar menu creates a large free-form menu on top of your editing window.  The expanded menu contains selectable menu  buttons and places for you to type text.	***THE CHARACTER LOOKS MENU***Generally speaking, you select the text you want to  change, set the entries in this menu up as you want the text to appear, then make the change by hitting the APPLY button.The second line of the menu is a list of character properties which can be modified independently.   Each of the menu buttons has three states: if the button appears white-on-black, that property will be turned on; if the button appears with  a diagonal line, that property will be turned off; if the button appears black-on-white, that property will be left alone.      ***THE PARAGRAPH LOOKS MENU***Below this menu, if you scroll it up far enough, is a solid black rectangle, used for setting indentations, and a ruler, used for setting tab stops.The second line of the menu is for specifying how the paragraph margins are to be justified.The space between lines in a paragraph is called line-leading.  You can specify it in units of printers points.You set the paragraph margins using the ruler on the bottom.  There are three margin values:  the paragraph's first line, the rest of the paragraph, and the paragraph's right margin.Since the editing window may be narrower than the document, you can also set the right margin beyond the edge of the window.**********************************************************************************************************C)  ANNOLANDANNO is a system to help multiple authors write papers.  It provides two facilities: edit marks and annotations.  The edit mark facitlity keeps track of changes that are made to a document.  Any changes made by one author can be seen by the other author with deletions struck out and new text in bold type.  The original author can then go through and accept or reject individual changes.Annotations are a hypertext facility that allows textual or graphic information to be associated with places in a document.  They can be whatever you want: remarks about the content, amplifications, notes to oneself, comments on style, coments on content, and points to check, etc.  Each annotation has a link type that distinguishes between different types of annotations.  There is a reference to each annotation in the body of the document, that appears much as footnotes might.  This 'pointer' can be followed (selected with the mouse) to see the contents of the annotation.  An annotation itself can be annotated; those annotations can in turn be annotated, etc.  In this way, one can track a 'dialogue' of comments, or can build a structure of points to be checked about stylistic comments.This many-layered structure can be hard to navigate, if all you can see is the local structure.  Anno provides a window which displays the overall structure - what annotations there are and how they are related, laid out as a graph.  Each node of the graph represents a single annotation, and can be followed to see the annotation itself; the arc between two nodes is labelled to show their relationship.In working with a document, one often needs to find a particular annotation - often, one knows what the annotation was about, but not where it was.  Anno provides a summary of the annotations for each document.  This summary can be used as a table of contents, listing enough of each annotation to indicate its content.When an annotated document is saved, the annotations follow along; when it is loaded for editing, the annotations are retrieved as well.  They may be edited (deleted or moved) like any other character.	1.  EDIT MARKSThe Edit Mark facility keeps track of changes that are made to a document.  The item 'Edit Marks' in the TEdit menu is used to control whether edit changes are kept or not, and whether edit changes are displayed or not, and to accept or reject the edit changes of a selection.  These subitems are obtained by rolling the cursor out the right side of the 'Edit Marks' item.When displaying of edit marks is turned on, new text appears in bold type, and deleted text is struck through.  If displaying of edit marks is turned off, deleted text is not shown and new text appears in a normal face.  The displaying of edit marks is turned on by the 'Show Edits' submenu item and turned off by the 'Don't Show Edits' command. Switching the mode of  display for edit marks may take a while.	2.  ANNOTATIONSAnnotations are added by selecting the 'Annotate' command from the TEdit menu (by using the middle button on the title bar).  It will bring up a multi-menu with three choices.  The leftmost choice is the link name.  Choosing 'New Link' will prompt you for a link name.  The second choice is the substance type which can be  TEXT, SKETCH, or FILE.  The third choice indicates whether to insert the specified annotation or abort.An overview of the annotations in a document can be obtained in either a summary window or a graph of their structure.  The 'Summary of Annos' menu subcommand will open a window above the edit window that contains a one line discription of the annotations on the document.  The description includes the annotation ID, its link type, the creator and as much of its text as will fit.  The annotation summary window will automatically scroll so that the last annotation displayed in the main window is visible in the summary.  Selecting a line from the summary will open a window onto the annotation summarized there.The 'Show Graph of Annos' menu subscommand will open a window above the edit window that contains a graph of the annotations in a document.  Annotations onto annotations will be shown as subgraphs to the right of the annotation.  Selecting a node in the graph and selecting the 'See Contents' item will open a window onto that annotation.3. SCRIPT =>	The purpose of this demo is to introduce you to text tools in Interlisp and to show off a means by which collaborative writing may be enhanced and accelerated.  The Interlisp-D programming environment, used with a XEROX AI Workstation, provides the window-based system necessary for text transformations to take place.  This may be through  Interlisp function calls or menu driven applications, providing both the programmer and the typist an elegant, yet simplistic, access to textual  data.  Text applications, written in Interlisp-D, can be used to deliver, print, and answer mail as well as create, edit and change the appearance of existing text.			The scenario of the demo centers around this multi-user environment. I have spent some time writingten a paper for Xeroxsome documentation and have handed it over to Mr. Stansbury to critique.  He, in turn, has communicated to me via electronic mail1.  Introduce Lafite	We are pleased to announce the Interlisp-D message system named 'Lafite, our  electronic mail system for reading and sending mail.	 You can divide mail you receive amongst several mail folders, organized as you will.  However, for the purposes of this demo, there is only one mail folder with the option of bringing up another.  You can open a browser window on any such folder:   => Open browser on {DEMO}ACTIVE.MAIL.  	  -left-button Browse in the Lafite window	  -select {DEMO}ACTIVE.MAIL	Text applications, written in Interlisp-D, can be used to deliver, print, and answer mail as well as create, edit and change the appearance of existing text.	The main part of the window displays the table of contents, a one line summary of each message.  Above the table of contents is a horizontal menu, containing commands specific to that mail folder.    The GET MAIL command is used for retrieving new mail as detected in the Lafite Status Window.  I can DISPLAY  a message:    => Display the message	   -select the message from Stansbury.pa			regarding "MESSAGE CONCERNING TEXT"	   -left-button the DISPLAY field of the 		browser window	This message has been sent to me in response to my request for some proof reading and critiquing.  He further explains that the new edited version now exists in the file {DEMO}AITEXT.  I would like to answer his message:    =>Answer his message	-select ANSWER in the browser window menu		The fields in this message template have been automatically set to REPLY TO the sender of the intended message.  Note that the subject field is a reply; the TO field becomes the FROM field from the previous message; and copies will be made for the sender of the message I am answering.    =>Answer the message	  -hit the DELETE key	  -COPY the question found in the 		message to the answer window	One of the features of Interlisp editors is the ability to  copy data  from one location to the other without retyping. 		  -answer the question by typing: "VIA TEXT AND 		GRAPHIC DISPLAY"	  -type your name in salutation	  -copy (shift select) the drawing and make 		a remark of your own	  -DELIVER it	While I have truely been editing in the message system Lafite, I will now move to a more complicated form of editing, using, however, THE SAME EDITOR, TEdit.  To view and analyze the contents of this new file, we will initiate an editing process via the Interlisp text editor TEdit.   2. Introduce  TEdit   => Bring up TEdit	  -click left in the top-level type script window 	  -copy "(TEDIT '{DEMO}AITEXT)"This is a good example of the ease with which you can edit text.  Although this is  a simple interface, the power invovled cannot be overlooked.  With this extensive menu of options, one can edit with tremendous ease.  	 =>Bring up the Expanded Menu	 -middle-button title bar of TEdit windowIn this Style Sheet, you generally select the text you want to alter or manipulate  and then make the change by either selecting the apply button or selecting the associated command, like HARDCOPY.	TEdit is a window-based, modeless text editor capable of handling fonts and formatting.  It is used with an extensive array of menus and subcommands to guide your way toward a rich document filled with different stylistic textures. With TEdit, text is selected with the mouse, and all editing operations act on the current selection.         =>Position Character and Paragraph Looks menus	 -scroll the Explanded Menu window so that the Character Looks Menu line is at the top	The Character Looks menu allows for the changing of the actual appearance of the document, with regard for display (like Italics and Underlining), fonts, and script size.  Each of the menu buttons has 3 states either turned on, off, or left alone.  Realizing that I don't care for the title's fonts, I would like to:    =>Change the title	 -select 'Rapid Prototyping' and SHOW	 -select the TITLE (XAI)	 -select APPLY	 -scroll up the Expanded Menu window to show		the Paragraph Looks menuIn the Paragraph Looks Menu, you select the text you want to change, and then select the entries as you wish the text to appear and then select APPLY.  The second line of the menu is for specifying how the paragraph margins are to be justified.  You can select line and paragraph leading as well as the type of tabs to be used.    =>Select the text and parameters	 -select the portion of the text with 		the enumerations	 -select the margins to be centered	 -set line-leading to 3 printer's points	 -select APPLY	 -SCROLL TO BEGINNING OF DOCUMENT	 -CLOSE EXPANDED MENU!!!3.  Introduce ANNOLAND	In addition to the standard text editing tools, there are two items which can be seen as being very useful during collaborative writing: 1. Marginal comments, and 2. Marking up a document and being able ot see its before and after stages.	  ANNOLAND is an application  program built on top of TEdit and includes editmarks and annotations, as a hypertext facility,  specifically designed to aide in collaborative writing.  This research project is a continuous, ongoing effort to develop extensive text handling tools for the multi-user environment created at PARC by Richard Burton and his colleagues.	a. Edit Marks	What you're seeing is the original state of my      document.  After I gave my paper to Mr. Stansbury, he marked it up and then desired not to have the editmarks be seen when it was delivered.  WHen I ask to show the editmarks, the document will appear in the form that he feels is better than my original.    =>Note the deletions and insertions	  -middle-button the title bar of the window and 		select Edit Marks->Show Edits	The Edit Marks facility keeps track of the changes made to a document.  When the displaying of editmarks is turned on, like it is now, new text appears in Bold type and deleted text is struck through.  As you will note, he has added a sentence which I feel is a good idea and so I am going to make it part of the text:    =>Select the text in Bold lettering	  -select the sentence in Bold type	  -select Edit Marks->Accept Changes	The text drawn through with a line is text which I had originally put into the document, but have been made to realize, by his suggestion, that it doesn't belong.  So, I will, indeed, delete it permanently:    =>Select the text which is drawn through	  -select the sentence which is drawn through	  -select Edit Marks->Accept changes					->Accept  all changesb.  Annotations	Annotations are a hypertext facility allowing textual or graphic information to be associated with places in a document.  They can be whatever you want: remarks about the content, amplifications, notes to oneself, comments on style, comments on content, and points to check, etc.  When you want to display annotations you can ask them to be seen:    =>Show Annotations	  -select Annotate->Show Annos	One way to show or edit the contents of an annotation is to ask to see its contents:    =>ask to see the contents	-middle button the first annotation COMMENT	-select SEE CONTENTS	This is a comment made  by my colleague refering to the document.  Because there is a full text editor running behind each annotation, I can further annotate this comments:    =Add an annotation	-middle buttonthe Comment window	-select Annotate->Add an Anno	-select Comment, Text, Done	-type in a response, i.e. 		"Sources came from all over!"	-close the window	-SCROLL UP	It is just as easy to perform graphical annotations as it is to add text, with the intention of simulating a white-board. Just as on an ordinary white-board, one can freely draw, erase and alter text, drawings and lines, so it is with the sketching facility in ANNOLAND.    =>Show sketch	 -middle-button the EXAMPLE annotation and 		select See Contents	-middle-button the title bar of the sketch	-select Fix Menu	By way of this new Sketch menu, you can draw and manipulate lines,  curves,  and text, as well as, make annotations inclusive of the annotation.  For example:    =>Alter the Sketch        -left-button the cursor after the 't' in  		ETHERNET	   -type DIAGRAM	This has shown the ease with which you can insert text centered around a given point.	 -select the rectangle	 -draw rectangle around 'ETHERNET DIAGRAM'	 -select MOVE 	By now clicking around the window, one can very easily draw lines as rapidly as one could do on a white-board. 	 -left-button the lower point of the 		rectangle just 		drawn, and click left to lower the rectangle	 -middle-button to draw lines to form a cube 		out of the box    	 	Often times, there is a portion of a document  of which you would like to get a closer or further view.  By selecting the MOVE VIEW->AUTO ZOOM feature of this submenu, I can simply Zoom in and out of the given region, similar to moving a magnifying glass toward  or away from the document.  While doing this I am scaling the sketch with reference to the position of the caret.  Note also the change in fonts as I zoom in and out of the document.		-select MOVE VIEW->Auto zoom		-hold the left button down within 			the sketch window in between 			the center and the perimeter			CLOSER TO THE OUTSIDE!!!		-hold down the middle button 			within the sketch window in  			between the center and the perimeter		When you finish, the sketch should be back to normal size or a bit larger for ease of seeing.		-CLICK RIGHT-BUTTON  OUTSIDE OF 			THE WINDOW TO STOP ZOOMING!!!	DO NOT CLOSE THE SKETCH WINDOW!!!	In cooperation with the idea that the less typing the better,not only are we able to copy streams of  text but the actual sketches themselves. If you decide at this point that it would be best to actually have the sketch in the document itself:    =>Copy sketch	  -position cursor where you want the 		sketch to be	Make sure there is enough of the screen visible to contain the ENTIRE sketch., otherwise the sketch will not appear!	  -^O, bringing up a new window	  -in box, type (GETREGION)	  -draw the area of the sketch with the mouse	  -<CR>-	  -close the sketch window		Because the outline of such annotations can be rather intimidating, an overview of the annotations in a document can be obtained in either a summary window or a graph of their structure.    =>Show graph and summary	  -select Annotate->Summary of Annos	  -select Annotate->Show Graph of Annos	In the annotation summary window,  there are fields for the Identification, Link Type, Creator, and a small portion of its content; here also, one can easily inspect the contents of an annotation:    =>Show contents of an annotation	 -left-button the last annotation of the summary			By analyzing this document through the message system, the text editor and the experimental hypertext facility, we hope we have shown the extensive value of the Interlisp environment through the XEROX AI Workstation.END.			        			        GACHA 
