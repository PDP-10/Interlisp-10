The flow of information in the process exhibits certain invariances that can be characterized as an abstract structure.  This is what a linguistic level of representation'' is.  For example, the computations involved in recognizing or producing sentences recur in a way that can be abstractly represented as phrase structure.  The phrase structure representation abstracts away from the order in which analysis paths may be chosen in the computational search space, and reflects instead the structure of an equivalence class of computations.z18062l3527d4056x10e14jAlthough phrase structure is a highly abstract representation, the information that it structuresnamely, the sequencing and categorization of words in a sentenceis relatively superficial among grammatical properties.  A study of the flow of deeper'' grammatical properties with respect to this phrase structure reveals a more abstract organization of linguistic information.  These deeper properties include information about the grammatical relations of wordstheir subjects, objects, and other arguments; control and anaphoric binding relations; inversion relations (in which, for example, a subject may be expressed as an object in the presence of an expletive or oblique subject); case assignment properties; thematic roles; referential indices; and grammatical number and number agreement.z18062l3527d4056x10e14jWhat does it mean to speak of the flow of grammatical properties with respect to phrase structure?  We suppose that partial information about the deeper grammatical properties is locally available in the surface form of any fragment of language, and that the partial information from each local piece of surface structure must be accumulated and combined with the information from other pieces in a order free, or monotonic, way (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982).  Indeed, this assumption seems the most plausible way to account for the ease and naturalness with which we understand arbitrary sentence fragments and for our extensive use of fragments in discourse contexts.  The computational problem of synthesizing this information under these conditions can be solved by a process of simultaneous constraint satisfaction, using a class of algorithms based on recursive unification over equality (Kay ref?, Kaplan and Bresnan 1982, other refs?).  If we abstract away from the possible computational orders in which this process may discover and combine grammatical properties, we can see certain invariances in how the information propagates or flows'' across regions of phrase structure.  These invariances can be abstractly characterized as a mapping from phrase structure to functional structure (Bresnan ed., Peters ref.).z18062l3527d4056x10e14j\34i4I361i10I5i9I898i1I[Principles governing this mapping have been stated in Bresnan (C&C), Grimshaw ch. 2, and elsewhere.

In general, the subcategorizations of V1 and V2 are satisfied in [S X [V1 Conj V2] Y] just in case they are satisfied in [S X V1 Y] Conj [S X V2 Y].z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\47i3I79o252 1o0 6o252 1o0 19o252 1o0 5o252 1o0 7o252 1o0 41o252 1o0 4o252 1o0 10o252 1o0 4o252 1o0An apparent counterexample to this generalization is example (3).z18062l3527d4056x10e14j3)	Bill belched and consumed the pie.z18062l3527d4056x10e14j3')	*Bill belched the pie and Bill consumed the pie.z18062l3527d4056x10e2jHowever, (3) is easily explained by an alternative analysis:  (3) contains not the conjoined verbs [V[Vbelched] and [Vconsumed]], but the conjoined VPs [VP[VPbelched] and [VPconsumed the pie]].  This analysis also explains the contrast between (4) and (5), because conjoined constituents commute.1 [Footnote 1: modulo implied temporal sequence and excluding pseudo-conjunctions like come and get it.]z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\100o252 1o0 1o252 1o0i7I2i3I2o252 1o0i8I27o252 2o0 1o252 2o0i7I2i3I2o252 2o0i16I106o4 1o0 86i15I4)	Bill consumed the pie and belched.z18062l3527d4056x10e14j5)	*Bill consumed and belched the pie.z18062l3527d4056x10e2jI.2. subjectsz18062l3527d3520x10e14j\b13BSubjects distribute across conjoined VPs.  This fact is revealed by patterns of anaphora.  A reflexive pronoun may normally have either a subject or object antecedent within a simple clause:z18062l3527d4056x10e14j6)	Maryi asked Johnj about herselfi/himselfj.z18062l3527d4056x10e14j\7o252i1o0I11o252i1o0I14o252i1o0I8o252i1o0IYet an object in one of two conjoined VPs is not a possible antecedent for a reflexive in the other VP:z18062l3527d3520x10e14j7)	Maryi met Johnj and asked about herselfi/*himselfj.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\7o252i1o0I9o252i1o0I24o252i1o0I9o252i1o0IThis fact is explained by the distributivity of subjects and the failure of the object John to distribute in this structure:z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\87i4I7')	Mary met Johnj and Maryi asked about herselfi/*himselfj.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\17o252i1o0I9o252i1o0I20o252i1o0I9o252i1o0IAn alternative explanation for the contrast between (6) and (7) is that John c-commands the reflexive in (6) but not in (7).  (6) and (7) have the respective phrase structures given schematically in (8) and (9).z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\72i4I8)            S       NPi             VP               V      NPj        PP                             P         NPkz18062l3527d4064x10e14jk144\26o252i1o0I41o252i1o0I53o252i1o0I9)              S         NPi               VP                 VP       Conj         VP             V       NPj           V       NPkz18062l3527d4064x10e14jk144\30o252i1o0I85o252i1o0I21o252i1o0INPj c-commands NPk in (8) because every node that dominates NPj also dominates NPk.  But NPj does not c-command NPk in (9) because there is a node (the left conjunct VP) which dominates NPj and does not also dominate NPk.  Perhaps the extra VP node in the coordinate structure of (9) prevents NPj's c-commanding NPk.z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\2o252i1o0I14o252i1o0I44o252i1o0I18o252i1o0I9o252i1o0I22o252i1o0I73o252i1o0I30o252i1o0I75o252i1o0I18o252i1o0IHowever, c-command is known to fail as a condition on anaphora (Bresnan C&C; Bresnan, Halvorsen, and Maling).  In (10) and (11), for example, the antecedent John fails to c-command the reflexive, because it is dominated by a node (the PP) which does not also dominate the reflexive.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\157i4I10)	a.

We know of no explanation for this.]z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\224o4 1o0 122o4i1o0I1i58o4 2o0 62IOne might attempt to redefine the c-command relation in such a way as to exclude problematic nodes like the PPs in (10) and (11).  In fact, Reinhart's (1976, LI) definition already requires either the first non-branching node above the c-commanding constituent, or the next higher node, if it is of the same type, to dominate the c-commanded constituent; and this formulation could, of course, be amended further to account for (10) and (11).  Applied to (12), Reinhart's formulation would allow himj to c-command Johnk because the coordinating VP node is presumably of the same type as the left conjunct VP that dominates himj..z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\287i25I184i3o252 1o0I14i4o252 1o0I104i3o252 1o0I12)	Mary met himj and invited Johnk to join her team.  (not: j = k)z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\16o252i1o0I17o252i1o0I26i1I3i1IAssuming with Reinhart (1976) that a pronoun cannot corefer to a nonpronominal NP that it c-commands, this formulation of c-command can account for the noncoference in (12).  But (12) has the structure of (9), so c-command now leaves us with no explanation for the contrast between (6) and (7).  The distributivity of subjects remains as an explanation for this contrast.z18062l3527d3520x10e14jI.3. controllersz18062l3527d3520x10e14j\b16BThe controller of conjoined complements distributes across the conjuncts:z18062l3527d4064x10e14j13)	Maryi made Johnj proud of himselfj and fond of heri.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\8o252i1o0I10o252i1o0I17o252i1o0I16o252i1o0I14)	*Maryi made Johnj proud of himj and fond of herselfi.z18062l3527d4064x10e2j\9o252i1o0I10o252i1o0I13o252i1o0I20o252i1o0IThus the pattern of anaphora in (13)-(14) follows from that in (13')-(14'), where the controller Johnj is distributed:z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\97i4o252 1o0I13')	Maryi made Johnj proud of himselfj and Maryi made Johnj fond of heri.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\9o252i1o0I10o252i1o0I17o252i1o0I9o252i1o0I10o252i1o0I12o252i1o0I14')	*Maryi made Johnj proud of himj and Maryi made Johnj fond of herselfi.z18062l3527d4064x10e2j\10o252i1o0I10o252i1o0I13o252i1o0I9o252i1o0I10o252i2o0I15o252i1o0IThe same holds for the controlled infinitives in (15).z18062l3527d3520x10e14j15)	Maryi convinced Johnj to leave heri/*herselfi alone and to occupy himselfj/*himj otherwise.z18062l4896d4064x10e14j\8o252i1o0I15o252i1o0I13o252i1o0I9o252i1o0I28o252i1o0I5o252i1o0I15')	Maryi convinced Johnj to leave heri/*herselfi alone and Maryi convinced Johnj to occupy himselfj/*himj otherwise.z18062l4896d4064x10e2j\9o252i1o0I15o252i1o0I13o252i1o0I9o252i1o0I15o252i1o0I15o252i2o0I17o252i1o0I5o252i1o0II.4. expletive inversionz18062l3527d3520x10e14j\b24BExpletive inversion is illustrated in (16) and (17):z18062l3527d4064x10e14j16)	a.

Moreover, a subject that refers to a situation rather than to an individual object can also replace there.  Cf: That's one more cab stolen.  *That car is one more cab stolen.  On the subject status of inverted locatives like somewhere in (16) and (17), see Levin thesis.]  These examples illustrate the generalization that the sequence NP be AP/VP can be inverted to be NP AP/VP only if there fills the subject position.  In effect, there triggers' the inverted order be NP AP/VP.  In coordinate structures such as (18), there triggers this inverted order in both conjuncts, allowing for a curious restriction on the presence of finite be:z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\43i2I13i5I147i5I7i62I51i10I104i2I26i2I18i5I41i5I31i2I51i5I110i2I18)	There was a cab stolen and (*was) a driver missing.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jIn other words, the inversion-triggering property of there distributes across the conjuncts:z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\53i5I18')	There was a cab stolen and there was a driver missing.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jWhat is the source of the restriction on finite be? A possible explanation lies in Falk's (Lg) analysis of the English auxiliary.  If the finite be is dominated by S, as Falk (Lg) proposes, rather than VP, then the unacceptable form of (18) must involve conjoined Ss rather than conjoined VPs.  This means that the subject of the second conjunct must have been ellipted, as illustrated in (19).z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\48i2I94i3I19)                        S            S               Conj                S     NP    Vaux   . . .        and          NP    Vaux    . . .     there   is                           there    isz18062l3527d4064x10e14jk144\93o252 3o0 36o252 3o0But ellipsis of expletive there is severely restricted, compared to nonexpletive NPs, as the contrast between (20) and (21) shows.z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\26i5I20)	That was a mistake, but was not a deliberate mistake.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j21)	*There was a mistake, but was not a deliberate mistake.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jThis contrast would explain the restriction on (18): the bad form of the example involves S coordination and expletive subject ellipsis, while the good example involves non-S coordination.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jI.5. case assignmentz18062l3527d3520x10e14j\b20BThe case assignment to an argument of coordinated verbs is predictable from the coordination of the individual verb-argument combinations: that is, the grammaticality of [NP1-case [V1 Conj V2] NP2-case] is predictable from [NP1-case V1 NP2-case] Conj [NP1-case V2 NP2-case].  To see this, we will turn from English, whose case system is degenerate and eroding, to Icelandic.

We would expect subject case assignment to behave the same as object case assignment with respect to distributivity, but the case of the subject in (24) is an apparent counterexample:z18062l3527d4064x10e14j24)	Baturinn flaut og rak.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk36		the-boat-nom floated and driftedz18062l3527d4064x10e2j24')	*Baturinn flaut og baturinn rak.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jk36		the-boat-nom floated and the-boat-nom driftedz18062l3527d4064x10e2j(24') is ungrammatical because the verb rak takes an accusative subject:z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\40i3I25)	Batinn rak.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk36		the-boat-acc driftedz18062l3527d4064x10e2jYet in (24), the subject of rak is nominative.z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\28i3IThe apparent counterexample (24) can be explained by an alternative analysis shown in (26).z18062l3527d4064x10e14j26)                  S           S         Conj          S      NP        VP    og      NP       VP    baturinn       flaut          batinn      rak    the-boat-nom   floated   and   the-boat-acc   driftedz18062l3527d4064x10e14jk144In (26) there is ellipsis of the subject of the second S conjunct. Such an alternative analysis is not available for (22) or (23): when both verbs are transitive, as in those examples, coordination of higher VP or S nodes would be revealed by the presence of two objects in the string of words; only when both verbs are intransitive as in (24) does the string admit of this structural ambiguity.z18062l3527d3520x10e14jRognvaldsson (1982) cites examples similar to (24) as evidence that some coordinate VPs are derived by reduction from coordinate sentences.  (26) incorporates this basic idea by allowing subject ellipsis as distinct from VP and V coordination.  (26) predicts that the case marking of the subject must satisfy the first, not the second, verb (which has its own, ellipted, subject).  Hence if we commute the Ss, again ellipting the subject of the second conjunct, the result should be grammatical.  And if we commute the verbs only, the result should be ungrammatical.  Both predictions are correct:z18062l3527d4064x10e14j27)	Batinn rak og flautz18062l3527d4064x10e14jk36		the-boat-acc drifted and floatedz18062l3527d4064x10e2j28)	*Baturinn rak og flaut.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jk36		the-boat-nom drifted and floatedz18062l3527d4064x10e2j(Note that ellipsis of the subject is restricted to the right conjunct.)z18062l3527d3520x10e14jWhile structure (26) provides a grammatical analysis of sentence (24), we expect structure (29) to be ungrammatical because the nominative subject cannot distribute across verbs which differ in their subject case-assignment properties.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j29)	*            S            NP         VP           baturinn       V                    V  Conj  V                   flaut  og   rakz18062l3527d4064x10e14jk162Yes/no questions provide a further test of this prediction.z18062l3527d3520x10e14jIn yes/no questions the Icelandic verb appears in initial position in the S.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j30)	Jon bordadi matinn.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk36\12f4 1f0 1f4 1f0		J. ate the-food-acc.z18062l3527d4064x10e2j31)	Bordadi Jon matinn?z18062l3527d4064x10e2jk36\7f4 1f0 1f4 1f0		ate J. the-food-acc.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jThe same is true of conjoined verbs.

In (41), for example, them is assigned the Agent role of kill and the Patient role of be killed.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\96i4I31i4I25i10I41)	As for the fish, don't let them kill each other or be killed by the cats.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jIn (42), me is assigned the Agent role of laugh and the Theme role of be happy.z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\9i2I31i5I23i8I42)	Nothing can make me laugh and be happy again.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jNote that subject ellipsis is not possible in these examples:z18062l3527d3520x10e14j43)	*Don't let them kill each other or them be killed by the cats.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j44)	*Nothing can make me laugh and me be happy again.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jThus, thematic role assignment differs crucially from case assignment: while an NP cannot have multiple conflicting case assignments (I.5), it can have multiple thematic roles without conflict.  This contrast suggests that assumptions in the transformational tradition regarding the uniqueness of theta role assignment'' are incorrect.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jI.7. referential indicesz18062l3527d3520x10e14j\b24BIn example (1) the same pie is both dedicated and given, but in (1') different pies may be involved:z18062l3527d4064x10e14j1)	John dedicated and gave a pie to Bill.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j1')	John dedicated a pie to Bill and John gave a pie to Bill.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jThus the truth conditions of (1) are not captured by the distributed form (1').  Is this then a nondistributive property?  We saw before that the arguments of conjoined verbs or verb phrases appear to distribute across the conjuncts (I.1-3).  We see now that any referential index (that is, any variable, indeterminate'' (Barwise & Perry), or discourse index'' (Kamp)) introduced by such an argument is also distributed across the conjuncts.  This property is not reflected in paraphrases like (1'), but it should presumably be reflected in the abstract structure that underlies (1), representing the organization of information in coordinated structures.z18062l3527d3520x10e14jSimilarly, the same reporters are involved in the two actions described in (45), but not necessarily in (45').z18062l3527d4064x10e14j45)	Two reporters came up to John and asked him about himself.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j45')	Two reporters came up to John and two reporters asked him about himself.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jAnd Bach (Defense) notes the same point in an example like (46)-(46'):z18062l3527d3520x10e14j46)	John was attacked and bitten by a vicious dog.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j46')	John was attacked by a vicious dog and John was bitten by a vicious dog.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jIn (46), under the conjoined verb analysis, trhe same dog has attacked and bitten; different dogs may be involved in (46').z18062l3527d3520x10e14jWould we expect the distributivity of referents to distinguish cases of VP or V coordination from S coordination with subject ellipsis (I.4-5)?  Not necessarily: an ellipted subject could be intepreted as a pronoun, picking up its reference from its antecedent.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jI.8. numberz18062l3527d3520x10e14j\b11BUnlike the properties previously discussed, the grammatical property of number does not distribute across conjuncts.  For example, the plural verb in (47) agrees with the coordinate subject, but not with the individual conjuncts (47'):z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\84i3I47)	Sally and John are here.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j47')	*Sally are here and John are here.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jSimilarly, the reflexive in (48) agrees in number with the conjoined subject, but not with the individual conjuncts (48'):z18062l3527d3520x10e14j48)	Both Sally and John talk a lot about themselves.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j48')	*Sally talks a lot about themselves and John talks a lot about themselves.z18062l3527d4064x10e2jNote that example (48) does have the distributed meaning that Sally talks a lot about herself and John talks a lot about himself, as well as the meaning that they each talk a lot about both of them.z18062l3527d3520x10e14jII. The Flow of Information Through Phrase Structurez18062l3527d3520x10e14j\b52BWe wish to solve the problem of coordination without merely classifying grammatical properties into those that do and those that do not distribute.  It is certainly useful to study and describe formally various modes of propagation that different grammatical features may have in coordinated and other structures (Sag, Gazdar, Wasow, Weisler 1983; Andrews ref).  However, our aim is to understand the structure of the information flow itself, insofar as it is general in language, and to derive the behavior of particular features from that abstract structure.z18062l3527d4064x10e14jFor the reasons outlined at the outset, we assume the LFG.  . . .z18062l3527d4064x10e14jThe solution we propose to the problem of coordination is based on a simple idea: the functional structure of a conjunction of constituents is the set of functional structures of the conjuncts.  The following rule schema expresses this idea:z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\82i111I49)	X  !  X  Conj  X	          # e "    # e "z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk36\7f5 1f0 24f5 1f0 1f4 1f0 1f5 1f0 4f5 1f0 1f4 1f0 1f5 1f0In (49) either the left conjunct X or the right Conj X sequence can be iterated arbitrarily.  We will leave aside this and other questions about the details of categorial structure, such as the number and types of categories (Peterson ref) and the structural position(s) of the conjunctions (Gazdar ref).  These details do not affect the essential features of our analysis.  We will also ignore for the moment the contribution to the functional structure of the choice of conjunction.z18062l3527d3520x10e14jThe effect of schema (49) is illustrated by the structures in (50).z18062l3527d4064x10e14j50)	annotated c-structure:            	                NP1    	             # e "          # e "                       	              NP2    Conj     NP3  	            Det   N   and   Det    N  	             a   boy         a    girl			f-structure:							f1		f2		DEF												PRED	BOY'									f3		DEF												PRED	GIRL'z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk234\4i22I32o252 1o0 18f5 2f0 1f4 1f0 1f5 1f0 10f5 1f0 1f4 1f0 1f5 1f0 41o252 1o0 15o252 1o0 89i12I8i1o252 1o0I2i1o252 1o0I2f1 36i1f0 1o252 1o0I2f1 28f0The c-structure is derived by taking X to be NP everywhere in rule (49).  The f-structure is derived by instantiating the annotations # e ".  The leftmost occurrence of # e " means that #, namely the f-structure corresponding to node NP2, is an element of ", namely, the f-structure corresponding to NP1.  We call the former f2 and the latter f1.  Thus, we know that f1 contains f2 as an element, and therefore that f1 is a set of f-structures.  We interpret the annotation on the right conjunct in the same way.  The result is that the f-structure corresponding to NP1namely f1is a set of two f-structures: f2, the f-structure of NP2, and f3, the f-structure of NP3.  The contents of f2 and f3 come from the familiar derivation of f-structures as described in Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), Bresnan (1982), and elsewhere. z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\134f5 1f0 1f4 1f0 1f5 1f0 30f5 1f0 1f4 1f0 1f5 1f0 12f5 1f0 49o252 1o0 19f5 1f0 45o252 1o0 22i1o252 1o0I16i1o252 1o0I22i1o252 1o0I10i1o252 1o0I35i1o252 1o0I150o252 1o0 8i1o252 1o0I31i1o252 1o0I23o252 1o0 6i1o252 1o0I23o252 1o0 19i1o252 1o0I5i1o252 1o0ITo attribute a simple grammatical property to an f-structure f, we write (f a) = v, where a is the grammatical attribute (a feature or function) and v is its value.  For example, we can attribute indefiniteness to f2 in (50) by writing (f2 DEF) = .  When an f-structure is a set of pairs, as f2 and f3 are in (50), (f a) = v is true just in case the pair <a v> e f.  Thus, in (50) (f2 DEF) =  and (f3 PRED) = GIRL', because <DEF > e f2 and <PRED GIRL'> e f3.  Boolean combinations of grammatical properties are also grammatical properties.  For example, (f2 DEF) =  _ (f2 PRED) = GIRL' is true of f2 in (50) because it is true that <DEF > e f2 or <PRED GIRL'> e f2.  See Kaplan and Bresnan (1982) for a detailed specification of functional descriptions.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\61i1I11i9I8i1I58i1I64i1o252 1o0I21i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 4f1 1f0 45i1o252 1o0I5i1o252 1o0I14i9I31i5I1f4 1f0 1i1I18i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 4f1 1f0 6i1o252 1o0I1f1 4f0 4f1 6f0 11f1 5f0 2f4 1f0 1i1o252 1o0I6f1 4f0 1f1 6f0 2f4 1f0 1i1o252 1o0I98i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 4f1 1f0 1f5 1f0 2i1o252 1o0I1f1 4f0 4f1 6f0 12i1o252 2o0I33f1 5f0 2f4 1f0 1i1o252 1o0I5f1 11f0 2f4 1f0 1i1o252 1o0IWhen an f-structure is a set of f-structures, as f1 is in (50), we must specify what it means to attribute grammatical properties to it.  The meaning we desire is of course the distributive one: a set of f-structures has a certain property just in case every f-structure element of the set has that property:z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\25i19I5i1o252 1o0I51)	Definition of set properties:z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk72\4i29IFor any set S of f-structures, (S a) = v just in case for every f e S, (f a) = v.

It is from these lexical schemata that the presence of SUBJ, OBJ and OBLGO functions in f2 ad f3 is inferred.  Thus a verb carries with it a skeleton form of the f-structures that it can occur in.  The actual values of the skeleton argumentsSUBJ, OBJ, etc.must be filled in by the surrounding lexical and syntactic structure.z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\41i8I5i4I47f5 1f0 1f1 4f0 4f1 12f5 2f1 7f5 2f1 6f5 2f1 3o252 2o0 3f0 6f5 1f0 1f1 4f0 4f1 8f5 2f1 7f5 2f1 6f5 2f1 3o252 2o0 3f0 84f1 9f0 5f1 3o252 2f0o0 14i1o252 1o0I4i1o252 1o0I146f1 9f0Since V1 is the head of VP, the f-structure of V1 will be identified with the f-structure of VP.  Therefore, the f-structure of VP must be the same set as that of V1, shown in (53).  It follows that any grammatical attribute of the VP f-structure must be a grammatical attribute of each of its f-structure elements, f2 and f3. For example, (f1 OBJ) = . . . means just that (f2 OBJ) = . . . and that (f3 OBJ) = . . . , by (51).  Hence, the f-structure of the VP in (52) must be that in (54).z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\7o252 1o0 40o252 1o0 115o252 1o0 151i1o252 1o0I5i1o252 1o0I16i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 27i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 20i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f054)		f1		f2		SUBJ										TENSE		PAST'								PRED		DEDICATE <(f2 SUBJ) (f2 OBJ) (f2 OBLGO)>'								OBJ		f4	DEF 												PRED	PIE'								OBLGO	f5	PRED	BILL'						f3		SUBJ										TENSE		PAST'								PRED		GIVE <(f3 SUBJ) (f3 OBJ) (f3 OBLGO)>'								OBJ		f4								OBLGO	f5z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk216\5i1o252 1o0I2i1o252 1o0I2f1 6f0o252 1f1o0 49f0i1o252 1f1 1o0I7f0i1o252 1f1 1o0I6f0i1o252 1f1 1o0I3o252 2o0 17f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 40o252 2f0o0 1i1o252 1o0I1f1 17i1f0 1o252 1o0I2f1 6f0o252 1f1o0 45f0i1o252 1f1 1o0I7f0i1o252 1f1 1o0I6f0i1o252 1f1 1o0I3o252 2o0 3f0 9f1 5f0i1o252 1f1o0I12o252 2f0o0 1i1o252 1o0IObserve that the same subsidiary f-structuresf4 and f5have functions in two different f-structures, f2 and f3.

Although f5 and f8 both contain the lexical contents of a pie, they represent different instantiations of the lexical features of a pie, corresponding to the different object NPs in the c-structure (91).  In the c-structure (52), in contrast, there is only one object NP, hence only one instantiation of features; the structure described by this instantiation is shared by the two conjunct f-structures.z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\109f1 3f0 59i1o252 1o0I5i1o252 1o0I28f1 4f0 38i4I14i1o252 1o0I12i1o252 1o0I5i1o252 1o0I38i5I69i5IThis difference in f-structures has semantic consequences.  The value of the PRED feature is a semantic form.  (In our representation of f-structures these are distinguished from other feature values by single quotes.)  Each instantiation of a semantic form creates a unique object for functional uniqueness andbecause it is functional structures that are semantically interpretedfor semantic interpretation (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982: p. 225). Thus, the two objects in the f-structures of distributed examples such as (55') can be interpreted differently, while the shared objects in examples such as (55) cannot be. See II.7.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j\77f1 4f0 14i13INote that tense is not a shared attribute of the conjuncts in (55).  This happens because tense is specified by the verbal inflections, and so must appear inside each verb's f-structure with all of the other lexical properties of the verb.  (See Bresnan C&C.)  This leads us to expect that the tense of conjoined verbs will be independent, as in fact it is:z18062l3527d4064x10e14j56)	a.

In (57), the auxiliary does specifies a tense attribute of the matrix f-structure, which is identified with a set; tense will therefore distribute into the conjuncts.

These features include TENSE, the PRED of make, and a lexically induced functional control relation which identifies the object of make as the understood subject of its open complement (Bresnan C&C).  This relation is expressed by the control schema (" OBJ) = (" XCOMP SUBJ), which is a predictable lexical property of make.  In the context of (65), this control schema means that (f0 OBJ) = (f0 XCOMP SUBJ).  Since (f0 XCOMP) = f1, we have (f0 OBJ) = (f1 SUBJ).  But f1 is a set of f-structures, and so the functional control property distributes across its element f-structures, f2 and f3, yielding (f0 OBJ) = (f2 SUBJ) and (f0 OBJ) = (f3 SUBJ), as shown in (66).z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\51f1 5f0 24i1o252 1o0I18f1 3f0 50i4I25f1 7f0 5f1 4f0 4i4I85i4I116f5 1f0 1f1 3f0 5f5 2f1 10f0 46i4I59i1o252 1o0I1f1 8f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 10f0 11i1o252 1o0I1f1 5f0 4i1o252 1o0I11i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 5i1o252 1o0I1f1 4f0 8i1o252 1o0I111i1o252 1o0I5i1o252 1o0I12i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 5i1o252 1o0I1f1 4f0 7i1o252 1o0I1f1 3f0 5i1o252 1o0I1f1 4f066)	f0		SUBJ							TENSE		PAST'					PRED		MAKE <(f0 SUBJ) (f0 OBJ) (f0 XCOMP)>'					OBJ		f4	PRED	JOHN'					XCOMP	f1		f2		SUBJ	f4											PRED		PROUD-OF <(f2 SUBJ) (f2 OBLTH)>'											OBLTH		PRED	PRO'														GEND	MASC														NUM	SG														PERS	3														NCL	+									f3		SUBJ	f4											PRED		FOND-OF <(f3 SUBJ) (f3 OBLTH)>'											OBLTH		PRED	PRO'														GEND	FEM														NUM	SG														PERS	3														NCL	z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk324\4i1o252 1o0I2f1 6f0o252 1f1o0 19f0 6f1 14f0i1o252 2f1o0I7f0i1o252 2f1o0I6f0i1o252 2f1o0I8f0 6f1 5f0i1o252 1f1o0I12f0 6f1 5f0 1i1o252 1o0I2i1o252 1o0I2f1 4f0 1i1o252 1f1o0I30f0i1o252 2f1o0I7f0i1o252 2f1o0I3o252 2o0 18o252 2o0 104i4f0 1o252 1o0I2f1 4f0 1i1o252 1f1o0I29f0i1o252 2f1o0I7f0i1o252 2f1o0I3o252 2o0 11i3I4o252 2o0 20i3I20i3I18i3I18i3I10f0Recall that the principles of bound anaphora require that the reflexive (+ncl) pronoun have an antecedent in its nucleus (f2), while the nonreflexive (ncl) pronoun not have an antecedent in its nucleus (f3) (Bresnan, Halvorsen, and Maling ref).  In either case, the only such antecedent is the subject, which has been identified with the matrix OBJ.  This explains (13) and (14).

This is effected by letting V be optional in VP; the general principles of coherence, completeness, and uniqueness then create the appearance of verb raising; see Bresnan, Kaplan, Peters, and Zaenen 1982, Falk ref, Ishikawa and Bresnan ref.  This analysis (67) accounts not only for the postnominal order of the modifiers (section I.4), but also for the absence of plural number with the conjoined phrases (see sections I.8 and II.8):z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\46i3I68)	*There were a cab stolen and a driver missing.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j69)	There were a stolen cab and a missing driver (to contend with).5z18062l3527d4064x10e2j\67o4 1o0[Footnote 5.

Therefore, the SUBJ attribute of the S f-structure will distribute into the conjunct f-structures, f2 and f3.  Furthermore, all the attributes of the Vaux was will distribute into the conjuncts.   These include the TENSE attribute, the PRED attribute, and the functional control attribute carried by be in expletive there constructions (Bresnan pass).  This last is expressed by the lexical schema (" OBJ) = (" XCOMP SUBJ).  In the context of (70) it implies that (f1 OBJ) = (f1 XCOMP SUBJ).  Hence, by (51) we have (f2 OBJ) = (f2 XCOMP SUBJ) and (f3 OBJ) = (f3 XCOMP SUBJ).  Similarly, from the lexical schema (" PRED) = BE <(" OBJ) (" XCOMP)>(" SUBJ)' it follows that (f2 PRED) =BE <(f2 OBJ) (f2 XCOMP)>(f2 SUBJ)' and (f3 PRED) =BE <(f3 OBJ) (f3 XCOMP)>(f3 SUBJ)'.

In (71) these features specify a locative nonproximate pronoun which is semantically empty (i.e. has no PRED).  This representation of expletive there differs minimally from that of the locative pronoun there (as in He is there), which presumably has a PRED value of PRO'.  The selection of there by was is then representable by a set of constraint equations in the lexical entry of be: (" SUBJ PROX) =c , (" SUBJ LOC) =c +, etc.z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\35i5I21f1 9f0 50i3I106f1 4f0 37i5I53i5I8i11I26f1 4f0 11f1 3f0 21i5I4i3I80i3I2f5 1f0 1f1 9f0 3o252 1o0 5f5 1f0 1f1 8f0 3o252 1o0In sum, the expletive subject there distributes (along with the verb was) across the conjuncts in the f-structure (71).

This is illustrated in (73).z18062l3527d3520x10e14j73)		f1		f2		SUBJ		PROX												LOC	+								TENSE		PAST'								PRED		BE <(f2 OBJ) (f2 XCOMP)>(f2 SUBJ)'								OBJ		f4	DEF												PRED	CAB'								XCOMP	f5	SUBJ  f4												PRED	STEAL <O (f5 SUBJ)>'						f3		SUBJ										PRED		BE <(f3 OBJ) (f3 XCOMP)>(f3 SUBJ)'								TENSE		PAST'								OBJ		f6	DEF												PRED	DRIVER'								XCOMP	f7	SUBJ  f6												PRED	MISSING <(f7 SUBJ)>'z18062l3527d4064x10e14jk288\5i1o252 1o0I2i1o252 1o0I2f1 5f0o252i1f1o0I66f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 6f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 8f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 20f0i1o252 2f1o0I42f0i1o252 1f1o0I7f0i1o252 1f1o0I26f3 1f0 1f1 1f0i1o252 2f1o0I13i1f0 1o252 1o0I2f1 6f0o252 1f1o0 21f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 6f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 8f0i1o252 1o0I1f1 42f0i1o252 2f1o0I45f0i1o252 1f1o0I7f0i1o252 1f1o0I29f0i1o252 2f1o0I8f0Observe that the subject there of the left conjunct f2 is not shared with the right conjunct f3.  As a result, the constraint equations of was in the right conjunct will fail to be satisfied, even if a rule of subject ellipsis interprets the empty SUBJ as an anaphoric element.6  This accounts for (18):z18062l3527d3520x10e14j\25i5I22i1o252 1o0I39i1o252 1o0I44i3I106f1 4f0 25o4 1o018)	There was a cab stolen and (*was) a driver missing.z18062l3527d4064x10e14j[Footnote 6.
