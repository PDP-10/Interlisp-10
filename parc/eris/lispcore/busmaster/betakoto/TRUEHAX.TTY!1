TRUEHAX is a small package providing for true and correct manipulation of numbers with arbitrary radices, including negative ones.  It provides for reading, printing, and constructing strings.  The functions provided are as follows:TrueRadixRead(radix file readtable)Reads a positive or negative number (indicated by '-'), possibly preceded by some number of SERPCHARs, from file using radix and readtable.  Use A for 10, B for 11, ... for radices greater than 10.  Prefixing a number in a negative base with a '-' will invert it, rather than guaranteeing a negative result.TrueRadixPrint(number radix file)Prints the number on the file in the radix, preceded by a '-' if the number is negative and the radix is positive.TrueMod(number modulus)Equivalent to IMOD unless both number and modulus are negative, in which case it gives the correct answer (which IMOD doesn't).TRS(number radix stringPointer)Returns a string with number in it per radix, via TrueRadixPrint.  Re-uses stringPointer if given.  Uses a fixed internal string, so copy the result if you want to hold on to it.Queries/Comments to hthompson.pa
