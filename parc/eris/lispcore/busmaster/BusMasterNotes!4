All three AI workstations of the 1100 family have Xerox proprietary busses which unnaturally raise the cost of adding new hardware features.   A common sales "knock-off" is our lack of some significant or insignificant peripheral: e.g. color displays, IEEE-488 intrument bus, touch panel, graphics tablet, telephone interface, scanner, etc.  Our answer has been limited to interfacing through RS232 or Ethernet;  these approaches are a mismatch for many medium to high performance peripherals.  Designing a new hardware interface typically costs $200,000 to $500,000.  Thousands of peripherals are available "off the shelf" for industry standard busses with prices between $500 and $5000.  All of our competition support some industry standard bus which gives them a competetive edge even for customers with no immediate need for new peripherals.  Engineering ResponseProduct Development proposes the 1108X "BusMaster" option to meet the customer need for hardware expansion and configurability.  BusMaster allows the 1108X Workstation to drive an industry standard bus in an expansion chassis outside the 1108 enclosure.  Two busses are to be initially supported: PC-bus and Multibus.   Engineering Assessment of Product Readiness 23-May-85  AIS Product Development hereby reports that the BusMaster-PC design is ready for 50 unit production.The first build of about 25 units has demonstrated basic producibility. The product functionality has been proven by field tests of 6 machines by the user interface designers of the Venture copier program in Herrietta under Jerry Boesel.  The first unit has been in service for 6 months. Don Tripp has provided "field" support and reports only one service call that uncovered a bad display controller card.  Three projects in ISL/PARC utilize the BusMaster for speech, telephone control and instrument control.  BusMasters have been in service about 5 months.  One unit developed occasional failues after a hardware revision change.  Flux was cleaned from the board and a suspicious wire replaced and the board has not failed since.  Installation procedures were confusing at first but have improved with better documentation.  Two BusMaster cards have been in use in XAIS Development for 6 months for color software work and speech demos.  Block transfer test running overnight with no transfer failures confirms DMA arbitration circuit.XAIS System Support Engineers attended a half day class in Pasadena in BusMaster capabilities and hands-on installation.SPG/ED has independently installed color demo hardware and software in preparation for FCC testing.The BusMaster design is under review by a third engineer in SPG/ED, and suggestions may be incorporated in the next week before the second printed circuit layout begins.While new improvements or patches may be found in the next two months of layout and production it is expected that only half a dozen wiring changes might be introduced in the assembly of the next build of 50 units.  Such rework would be minor and delay of production now does not seem justified. The following is the TIMING TABLE for DLion BX (Bus eXtension) port.Min	Max	Name	Parameter----	---	----	-------	137 ns		tCY	min BxClk period 39 ns		tCH	min BxClk high 98 ns		tCL	min BxClk low 36 ns		tS	min BxData output Setup time before (active falling) clock edge.  0 ns		tH	min BxData and BxAddr output Hold time after clock edge. 90 ns		tDO	max BxData Valid after previous clock edge.  			 10 ns		tVO	BxData Valid after clock edge 25 ns		tAddr	min BxAddr Setup time before clock high (inactive edge)  Here are the times by card and by bus.

Many requests for new hardware can be met by third party products interfaced to the 1108X through BusMaster.  System Support Engineers should be able to qualify and provide first level of response to customer requests for new devices.  Customers should be prepared to write Lisp software drivers for new devices or rely on LispUser contributed software.      Price and Availability      Suggested Sale Price is $3500.

If all is well the message "BusMaster, Receiver and bank 1 memory OK except as printed." will be typed and the function will terminate.  If  there is no memory with switches set to bank 1 then messages like "Expected: 0, Found: 255, Error in test: Remote Bank 1 Memory: zeros at ones" will be printed.  Color Displays for example do not need Bank 1 memory.  Speech does.  If other messages are printed trouble shooting is required. (BUSDMA.INIT)(Re)initializes the dma controller and memory refresh.  This command is necessary before dynamic RAM memory will retain data for more than a fraction of a second.(MakeBusBox)This test is an interactive test for localizing 'stuck bit' type faults, the major fault type in board building.A interactive test window is created surrounded by an action menu on the left and small parameter windows above.  Parameters that can be controlled are Memory address, port address, data, quiet boolean and loop boolean.  Parameter values can be cycled through the defaults with the left button over the center of the small parameter windows.  Center button over a parameter window gives an active menu of parameter choices.  Left buttoning the menu items on the left cause read or write cycles and the action is recorded in the major window unless the "Quiet" parameter is "yes".  The "Loop" parameter allows endless looping of any test for oscilloscope triggering and trouble shooting.  The looping is halted typeing control-E (prop's and E).(MakeBusmasterTest)This function creates in a window a block transfer memory tester, the most severe stress test for BusMaster. Many parameters can be set, and tests are started by the start menu. This tester collects data on intermittent errors in block transfers.  It tests the arbitration between the DMA controller performing refresh and the 1108 processor accessing the remote bus.BUSMASTER-MULTIBUS  HARDWARE CHECK LIST  1108X Dandelion with CPE Expanded Processor OptionBusMaster card (7 x 12 inches) removed from Dandelion bottom tray.BusMaster Ribbon cable (37 pin D female connector to CPE and 37 pin D male/female to BusMaster)Multibus Card Cage with power supply (BusMaster requires 3 Amps of 5 volts.)Multibus peripheral cards as needed (see Application Installation Instructions below)Tools required are screwdriver and phillips screwdriver.BUSMASTER-MULTIBUS  HARDWARE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONSExit from running software.  eg use (LOGOUT) to exit Interlisp.Power off Dandelion (Xerox 1108) and Expansion UnitRemove front cover of Dandelion.Install or verify presence of CPE Processor Option in front slot 3.Identify the BusExtender connector 3-2 (card 3 from right! connector 2 from top), which is the lower female 37-pin D-connector of CPE Expanded Processor Card in slot 3 in front of the 1108X Dandelion.

You can go as far as 3 - the default is 0. Note that you have to stop recording (with STOP) before you can do anything else. Try changing the compression by mid-but in the compression window -- 10 looks good.  (Note that because of a bug the new value will not be displayed therein until you next hit Record).Mid-but Play and you will get the last 1.2 seconds of what you said - use this to adjust the output amplification.  Use Quiet (right of Play) to shut it up.  You can scroll around a bit after recording , but you will fall off the end very quickly, which cause a break (^ is (here and nearly always) a safe recovery).  Better to show off scrolling with a file.  You can leave the original window up, and bring up a new one:(NewShow (MakeSSForFile 'f1 '{CORE}F1.SPEECH NIL 1024 10000)).Make this one a bit longer - maybe half the screen. Mid-but Record. Answer the prompt with something on the order of 5 or 10.It starts recording with no pause after displaying "Type STOP to stop", so be ready to say something witty.  It is a good idea to include pauses fairly frequently in what you say, so that subsequent segmentation is easier.  Say your piece and hit STOP.  Increase the compression, to 10 or even 30, so that most of the utterance is visible.Scroll around (include thumbing) to show off.  Mid-but Zoom (right of Link) to bring up a 10-to-1 expanded window below (this may require moving the whole ensemble - don't worry, they travel together).  Using the compressed window, extract a word or phrase by mid-but NewSS, giving it a name when prompted (or not if prompt window should get lost), e.g. the word you think it is, then respond to the cursor with "ss" in it by selecting first the left, thenthe right hand ends of the segment.  As long as you hold the left-but down, you can move the cursor around - the display shows time at the bottom and value and name at the top.  DO NOT try to scroll while placing marks.  Mid-but Toggle Marks, the right-but Redisplay to clean things up.  Now mid-but Play Subss (right of Play) and grab one end of the segment with the "ss" jaws cursor to hear the sub-segment (look for feed back.If you haven't got the boundaries right, then ToggleMarks in the lower, expanded window, Jump to the named mark, and use ChangeMark to drag a mark to a better position, then replay.  If you have several marks close together, you mayu get a menu to arbitrate a selection - don't ever take the 'all' option- it's not implemented yet.That's enought to be getting on with - all the menu items and sub-items have explain strings, so just hold on and you will get some help, I trust.NEWRTSD Real time Speech Spectrum DemoWelcome to the Xerox booth. We are showing our new expanded processor with floating point hardware, expanded control store, and array processor library running on larger memory.  Attached to the processor is an expansion unit for controlling industry standard peripheral cards -- in this case, IBM PC compatible peripherals.To demonstrate this new power, we have chosen a speech application, the processing of digitized speech and the computing of the spectogram display that you see in the center of the screen.  I would like to emphasize the vertical integration, the bringing together for the first time of an array processor with a highly productive software environment and excellent user interfaces. (RTSDINIT)A large window with attached menus will appear at bottom of screen.  Left-but Sample rate and Left-but 5(KHz).  Left-but "Real-time spectrum" and graphical speech spectrogram will appear in window and process microphone input in real time.  Adust the (left) volume control higher until grey background appears or until patterns are pleasing.  Whistling up and down in frequency will produce a stripe that rises and falls with sound pitch.  STOP key to stop.  Left-button Height and 2 will double the presentation size. (Play and Record are disabled).  We sample the speech 10,000 times a second, every hundred microseconds.  The primary structure that we want to display is the frequency content of this segment of speech.To do that we are going to treat this segment of speech as a repeating periodic wave form.  To do that accurately means that the left-hand side of the wave should meet the right-hand side, and it really doesn't.  We have discontinuities because the frequency content is always changing.  But for purpose of analysis, we're asking our algorithms to pretend that the frequency content of the speech is holding still across 25 milliseconds.  Now I want to see energy as a function of frequency, not of time.  So I perform a fast fourier transform. I display in the window  a plot of frequency vs time.  Each stripe of the speech is a picture of the frequency content within just 25 milliseconds, some one-fortieth of one second.  I'd like to compute this a hundred times a second.  I'd like to move down the speech wave form and compute the frequencies 10 milliseconds later, and 10 milliseconds after that and so on.  Here you can see some of the structure of speechthe horizontal stripes you see are harmonics of the vocal cords' fundamental frequency.  You see them particularly in the first KHz range, the bottom 20% of the scale.  There you see the structure of vowels.  This is a recognized form of printing speech that is used in speech research, in speech therapy, and a lot of speech disciplines.This demo is not meant to be a polished speech workbench, it's a sample of what can be done with the floating point performance of this machine.  Just to remind you, every vertical stripe required some 10,000 floating point operations.  To do this kind of speech work requires about a million floating point operations per second of speech, something that the DandeTiger, the 1108X, is able to do in real time.  It's worth speaking about the potential applications that this technology enables.  For the first time, one can combine sophisticated Interlisp programs, expert systems as well as numerical front ends and number crunching to build intelligent signal-processing applications.Our next new product is our expansion unit where we can drive industry standard peripherals, in this case, IBM PC cards.  We will be demonstrating the analog to digital conversion of speech in this chassis.  We can manipulate almost any peripheral using Lisp functions for reading a single address of the remote bus or writing a single address of the remote bus.  We also have block transfer primitives to transfer blocks of data between remote memory and local memory at bus bandwidth.  The bus master control is capable of running four DMA channels for driving high-speed devices.We will be reading a speech sample every 100 microseconds, transferring it into the remote memory by means of the DMA channel.  Periodically we will be transferring blocks of data from the remote memory to the local memory, using the block transfer.  This will be integrated with the continuous real time display of the speech spectrogram.  The peripheral expansion chassis is motivated by the desire to open more peripherals to our customers than we provide in our product line.  We have the means for customers to create their own peripherals or add some of the hundreds or thousands of existing peripherals, and integrate them from Lisp.  This way we can add color displays, special communications equipment, data acquisition kinds of things, even video disk controllers, optical memory.  Now, as I speak into the microphone, you see the picture of my voice appearing on the screen.  It's a lot of noise.  The structure is a little more clear if I were to whistle (do so).  As the sound goes up, you see the plot go up, and as the sound drops, you will see the plot line drop.  If I were to sing, you will see a more structured version of music.That wraps up our demonstration.   Customer List    Internal      PARC      Venture    External  Inventory    Vendors   1- Conrac model 7211c19 w/ LPP option  Supplier: Omega Video 14326 Iris Lawndale, CA (213) 643-9021 contact:Buzz Evans Delivery 8weeks, net. 30 Price Qty (10 units/year volume) =$3230 RGB cables in stock or producible   2.
