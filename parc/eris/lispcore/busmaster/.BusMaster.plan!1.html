All three AI workstations of the 1100 family have Xerox proprietary busses which unnaturally raise the cost of adding new hardware features.   A common sales "knock-off" is our lack of some significant or insignificant peripheral: e.g. color displays, IEEE-488 intrument bus, touch panel, graphics tablet, telephone interface, scanner, etc.  Our answer has been limited to interfacing through RS232 or Ethernet;  these approaches are a mismatch for many medium to high performance peripherals.  Designing a new hardware interface typically costs $200,000 to $500,000.  Thousands of peripherals are available "off the shelf" for industry standard busses with prices between $500 and $5000.  All of our competition support some industry standard bus which gives them a competetive edge even for customers with no immediate need for new peripherals.  Engineering ResponseProduct Development proposes the 1108X "BusMaster" option to meet the customer need for hardware expansion and configurability.  BusMaster allows the 1108X Workstation to drive an industry standard bus in an expansion chassis outside the 1108 enclosure.  Two busses are to be initially supported: PC-bus and Multibus.  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING  Hardware    CPE BusExtension Port SchematicThe following is the TIMING TABLE for DLion BX (Bus eXtension) port.Min	Max	Name	Parameter----	---	----	-------	137 ns		tCY	min BxClk period 39 ns		tCH	min BxClk high 98 ns		tCL	min BxClk low 36 ns		tS	min BxData output Setup time before (active falling) clock edge.  0 ns		tH	min BxData and BxAddr output Hold time after clock edge. 90 ns		tDO	max BxData Valid after previous clock edge.  			 10 ns		tVO	BxData Valid after clock edge 25 ns		tAddr	min BxAddr Setup time before clock high (inactive edge)  Here are the times by card and by bus.

Use Quiet (right of Play) to shut it up.  You can scroll around a bit after recording , but you will fall off the end very quickly, which cause a break (&uarr; is (here and nearly always) a safe recovery).  Better to show off scrolling with a file.  You can leave the original window up, and bring up a new one:(NewShow (MakeSSForFile 'f1 '{CORE}F1.SPEECH NIL 1024 10000)).Make this one a bit longer - maybe half the screen. Mid-but Record.

It is a good idea to include pauses fairly frequently in what you say, so that subsequent segmentation is easier.  Say your piece and hit STOP.

Mid-but Zoom (right of Link) to bring up a 10-to-1 expanded window below (this may require moving the whole ensemble - don't worry, they travel together).  Using the compressed window, extract a word or phrase by mid-but NewSS, giving it a name when prompted (or not if prompt window should get lost), e.g. the word you think it is, then respond to the cursor with "ss" in it by selecting first the left, thenthe right hand ends of the segment.  As long as you hold the left-but down, you can move the cursor around - the display shows time at the bottom and value and name at the top.  DO NOT try to scroll while placing marks.  Mid-but Toggle Marks, the right-but Redisplay to clean things up.  Now mid-but Play Subss (right of Play) and grab one end of the segment with the "ss" jaws cursor to hear the sub-segment (look for feed back.If you haven't got the boundaries right, then ToggleMarks in the lower, expanded window, Jump to the named mark, and use ChangeMark to drag a mark to a better position, then replay.  If you have several marks close together, you mayu get a menu to arbitrate a selection - don't ever take the 'all' option- it's not implemented yet.That's enought to be getting on with - all the menu items and sub-items have explain strings, so just hold on and you will get some help, I trust.NEWRTSD Real time Speech Spectrum DemoWelcome to the Xerox booth. We are showing our new expanded processor with floating point hardware, expanded control store, and array processor library running on larger memory.  Attached to the processor is an expansion unit for controlling industry standard peripheral cards -- in this case, IBM PC compatible peripherals.To demonstrate this new power, we have chosen a speech application, the processing of digitized speech and the computing of the spectogram display that you see in the center of the screen.  I would like to emphasize the vertical integration, the bringing together for the first time of an array processor with a highly productive software environment and excellent user interfaces. (RTSDINIT)A large window with attached menus will appear at bottom of screen.  Left-but Sample rate and Left-but 5(KHz).  Left-but "Real-time spectrum" and graphical speech spectrogram will appear in window and process microphone input in real time.  Adust the (left) volume control higher until grey background appears or until patterns are pleasing.  Whistling up and down in frequency will produce a stripe that rises and falls with sound pitch.  STOP key to stop.  Left-button Height and 2 will double the presentation size. (Play and Record are disabled).  We sample the speech 10,000 times a second, every hundred microseconds.  The primary structure that we want to display is the frequency content of this segment of speech.To do that we are going to treat this segment of speech as a repeating periodic wave form.  To do that accurately means that the left-hand side of the wave should meet the right-hand side, and it really doesn't.  We have discontinuities because the frequency content is always changing.  But for purpose of analysis, we're asking our algorithms to pretend that the frequency content of the speech is holding still across 25 milliseconds.  Now I want to see energy as a function of frequency, not of time.  So I perform a fast fourier transform. I display in the window  a plot of frequency vs time.  Each stripe of the speech is a picture of the frequency content within just 25 milliseconds, some one-fortieth of one second.  I'd like to compute this a hundred times a second.  I'd like to move down the speech wave form and compute the frequencies 10 milliseconds later, and 10 milliseconds after that and so on.  Here you can see some of the structure of speechthe horizontal stripes you see are harmonics of the vocal cords' fundamental frequency.  You see them particularly in the first KHz range, the bottom 20% of the scale.  There you see the structure of vowels.  This is a recognized form of printing speech that is used in speech research, in speech therapy, and a lot of speech disciplines.This demo is not meant to be a polished speech workbench, it's a sample of what can be done with the floating point performance of this machine.  Just to remind you, every vertical stripe required some 10,000 floating point operations.  To do this kind of speech work requires about a million floating point operations per second of speech, something that the DandeTiger, the 1108X, is able to do in real time.  It's worth speaking about the potential applications that this technology enables.  For the first time, one can combine sophisticated Interlisp programs, expert systems as well as numerical front ends and number crunching to build intelligent signal-processing applications.Our next new product is our expansion unit where we can drive industry standard peripherals, in this case, IBM PC cards.  We will be demonstrating the analog to digital conversion of speech in this chassis.  We can manipulate almost any peripheral using Lisp functions for reading a single address of the remote bus or writing a single address of the remote bus.  We also have block transfer primitives to transfer blocks of data between remote memory and local memory at bus bandwidth.  The bus master control is capable of running four DMA channels for driving high-speed devices.We will be reading a speech sample every 100 microseconds, transferring it into the remote memory by means of the DMA channel.  Periodically we will be transferring blocks of data from the remote memory to the local memory, using the block transfer.  This will be integrated with the continuous real time display of the speech spectrogram.  The peripheral expansion chassis is motivated by the desire to open more peripherals to our customers than we provide in our product line.  We have the means for customers to create their own peripherals or add some of the hundreds or thousands of existing peripherals, and integrate them from Lisp.  This way we can add color displays, special communications equipment, data acquisition kinds of things, even video disk controllers, optical memory.  Now, as I speak into the microphone, you see the picture of my voice appearing on the screen.  It's a lot of noise.  The structure is a little more clear if I were to whistle (do so).  As the sound goes up, you see the plot go up, and as the sound drops, you will see the plot line drop.  If I were to sing, you will see a more structured version of music.That wraps up our demonstration.   Customer List    Internal      PARC      Venture    External  Inventory    Vendors   1- Conrac model 7211c19 w/ LPP option  Supplier: Omega Video 14326 Iris Lawndale, CA (213) 643-9021 contact:Buzz Evans Delivery 8weeks, net. 30 Price Qty (10 units/year volume) =$3230 RGB cables in stock or producible   2.
