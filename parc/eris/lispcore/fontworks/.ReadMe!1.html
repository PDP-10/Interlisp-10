     This directory represents ongoing work by Frank Shih to support fonts.  This directory is separate and distinct both from {ERIS}&lt;LISP&gt;FONTS and  from {ERIS}&lt;LISPCORE&gt;FONTS.  Included in this directory will be new experimental fonts as developed.  These are also intended to be distinct from the fonts in {ERIS}&lt;LISPCORE&gt;FONTS.</pre>
