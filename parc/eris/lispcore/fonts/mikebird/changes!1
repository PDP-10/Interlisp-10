This is no longer a substitution of widths but a full font substitution - press file and or printer are given revised font.Revised font file/directory parameters are DISPLAYFONTDIRECTORIES, INTERPRESSFONTDIRECTORIES, PRESSFONTWIDTHSFILES.DISPLAYFONTEXTENSIONS is a atom/list of extensions to be used when searching for display fonts - initially DISPLAYFONT.Display and Interpress now always take first font matching face from file - ignoring family.  (They expect only one font per file).  Press still searches.Interpress no longer tries press widths.
