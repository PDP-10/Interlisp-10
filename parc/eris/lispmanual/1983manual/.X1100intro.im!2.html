Can type just as in Interlisp-10.  Break causes new window.  Windows move and shape using interactive commands on page ??."    --- par from lmm}Interlisp-D is an implementation of the Interlisp programming environment for the Xerox 1100 series of Scientific Information Processors.  Interlisp-D uses a byte-coded instruction set, deep binding, {lisp CDR} encoding (in a 32-bit {lisp CONS} cell) and incremental, reference-counted garbage collection.  Virtually all of the Interlisp-D system is written in Lisp.  A relatively small amount of microcode implements the Interlisp-D instruction set and provides support for a small set of other performance-critical operations.Interlisp-D is completely upward compatible with Interlisp-10.  All Interlisp system software runs under Interlisp-D.  The only exceptions are those explicitly indicated in the manual as applicable only to Interlisp-10.  In addition, Interlisp-D provides significant extensions that allow the user to exploit its personal computing environment.Interlisp-D has incorporated both low level network access and a collection of various higher level protocols used to communicate over an Ethernet with printing and file servers, as well as with other Interlisp-D processors.  In particular, all file operations are independent of whether the file resides on the local disk or on a remote file server.  See {PageRef Tag Ethernet} for further information about Interlisp-D facilities for communicating over an Ethernet.Interlisp-D includes an extensive collection of user graphics facilities. The most important of these is the window system, which allows the user to divide the screen into multiple autonomous overlapping regions.The window package provides both interactive and program accessable constructs for creating, moving, reshaping, overlapping, and destroying windows in such a way that a program can be embedded in a window in a completely transparent fashion.  This allows existing Interlisp-10 programs to be used without change, while providing a base for experimentation with more complex window operations in new applications.  The basic graphics facilities are described in {PageRef Tag WindowPackage}.Using the window system, Interlisp-D extends the existing Interlisp programming tools to use the display and also provides some completely new tools.  The display break package provides pushbutton access to the stack ({PageRef Tag DisplayBreak}).  A data inspection program uses windows to symbolically examine and change arbitrary system data structures ({PageRef Tag Inspector}).  A display-oriented structure editor allows convenient modification of Interlisp-D programs ({PageRef Tag Dedit}).{Begin SubSec Reporting Problems}{Title Reporting Problems}{TextThe Interlisp-D support team is committed to providing full support servicesto the entire Interlisp-D user community.

The mouse is moved about on the working surface next to the keyboard and may be placed on whichever side of the keyboard is most comfortable for the user.  As the mouse is moved, a cursor moves around on the display screen.The three keys on top of the mouse are used for various functions depending on the software being run and the cursor's location on the screen.{note some 1108s have 2-button mouse}}{End SubSec Mouse}{Begin SubSec Processor Cabinet}{Title Processor Cabinet}{TextThe processor cabinet houses the electronic circuitry and magnetic disk.  The only operator controls on the processor cabinet are two pushbuttons that are used to turn the power on and off.  The pushbuttons are located on the front panel.  Also located on the front panel is a numeric display that is used primarily for maintenance purposes.{note should have ptr to MP codes}The Xerox 1100 is microprogrammed with a control store of 4K, 36-bit words with a microinstruction cycle time of about 200 nsec.  The data paths within the machine are 16 bits wide and the processor-memory data path is 64 bits wide.  The standard real memory is 1.15 MBytes.  The memory is expandable to 1.5 MBytes.{note check memory sizes}The processor cabinet contains a Shugart SA 4008 disk, RS232 interface, and a printer port.

To do this, use (LOGOUT) to exit Lisp on the first machine and flush all dirty pages into the backing-store file, LISP.VIRTUALMEM. Then, place the first machine in FTP. Then, on the second machine, start lisp by saying:  	Lisp [firstmachine]LISP.VIRTUALMEMThis will "sysin" the virtual memory of the first machine. The process takes a few minutes, and is quite handy for moving from Dolphin to Dorado and back. Note: if the Lisp.virtualmem on the first machine is substantially larger than the virtual memory in use, there may be a pause when the sysin cursor reaches the bottom of the screen before Lisp starts up.  This glitch will be corrected in future releases.{End Note}{Begin SubSec Greeting}{Title Greeting}{TextWhen Interlisp-D is started, the currently logged in user (see the Executive {lisp Login} command) will be greeted.  There are two phases to the greeting process:  First, site-specific parameters are established by loading the file {lisp INIT.LISP} from the local disk.  This file should define where various resources (printers, Lispusers files, fonts) are to be found given the machine's location and configuration.It also specifies a search list (the variable {lisp USERGREETFILES}) for the greeting files of individual users.  If a user-specific initialization file is found by searching that list, the second phase of greeting consists of loading that file.  User initialization files customize Interlisp-D for a particular user, by specifying values for various parameters such as the default directory variable {var LOGINHOST/DIR} ({PageRef Var LOGINHOST/DIR}).  The disk is delivered with an {lisp INIT.LISP} that assumes there are no network facilities and that the user's initialization file is named {lisp INIT.{arg USERNAME}} on the local disk.  The file {lisp INIT.PARCPLACE} is included on the disk as an example of a site-dependent {lisp INIT.LISP} file for network sites.{note include sample init.lisp here?}}{End SubSec Greeting}}{End SubSec Starting Lisp}{Begin SubSec Cursor Status Indications}{Title Cursor Status Indications}{TextWhen Interlisp-D is running, the cursor will occasionally change to inform the user of certain system states.
