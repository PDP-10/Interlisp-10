{foot Since {fn SETQ} is an nlambda, {it neither} argument is evaluated during the calling process.  However, {fn SETQ} itself calls {fn EVAL} on its second argument.  Note that as a result, typing {lisp (SETQ VAR FORM)} and {lisp SETQ(VAR FORM)} to {fn LISPX} is equivalent:  in both cases {lisp VAR} is not evaluated, and {lisp FORM} is.}{comment endfootnote}
