In addition, {fn CLISPIFY} will convert LISP forms into "english" when {var CLISPIFYENGLSHFLG}{index CLISPIFYENGLSHFLG CLV} is {lisp T}.CLISP currently knows about the following unary relations in their singular and plural forms:{lisp ARRAY}, {lisp ATOM}, {lisp ATOMIC}, {lisp FLOATING POINT NUMBER}, {lisp LIST}, {lisp LITATOM}, {lisp LITERAL ATOM}, {lisp NEGATIVE}, {lisp NIL} (i.e., {lisp X IS NIL}), {lisp NULL}, {lisp NUMBER}, {lisp SMALL INTEGER}, {lisp SMALL NUMBER}, {lisp STRING};and the following binary relations in their singular and plural forms:{lisp EQ TO}, {lisp EQUAL TO}, {lisp GEQ}, {lisp GREATER THAN}, {lisp GT}, {lisp LESS THAN}, {lisp LT}, {lisp MEMB OF}, {lisp MEMBER OF}, {lisp TAIL OF}.All relationships can be negated with either {lisp NOT}, {lisp N}, or {lisp N'T}, e.g., {lisp X IS ~LESS THEN Y, A AND B AREN'T ATOMIC}.New relations can be defined via the function {fn NEWISWORD}.{FnDef {FnName NEWISWORD} {FnArgs SING PLU FORM VARS}{Text{arg SING} is the singular form of the new english construct, {arg PLU} the plural without the subject.  {arg FORM} is the form the singular construct translates to, and {arg VARS} the parameters.}}For example, "{lisp SMALL INTEGER}" could be defined by{lisp (NEWISWORD '(X IS A SMALL INTEGER) '(ARE SMALL INTEGERS) '(SMALLP X) '(X))}and "{lisp TAIL OF}" by{lisp (NEWISWORD '(X IS A TAIL OF Y) '(ARE TAILS OF Y) '(TAILP X Y) '(X Y))}}{End SubSec English Phrases}</pre>
