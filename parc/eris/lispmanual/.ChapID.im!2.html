{Begin Chapter Interlisp-D Specifics}{Title Interlisp-D Specifics}{TextInterlisp-D is an implementation of the Interlisp language that runs on the Xerox 1100, 1108, and 1132 machines.  It is completely upward compatable with the older Interlisp-10, except as specified in this manual.  The most significant extension to Interlisp is the window display package, described on {PageRef Tag WindowPackage}.  However, Interlisp-D also offers many other extensions, which are described in detail below.{Begin SubSec Interlisp-D Interrupt Characters}{Title Interlisp-D Interrupt Characters}{Text{index interrupt characters}{Tag InterruptCharsD}The table below gives the interrupt characters currently enabled in Interlisp-D.  Many of these are the same as those used in the Tenex version of Interlisp-10, but some have been removed, and some have had their meanings changed.  It is possible to change the assignments of control characters to interrupts using {fn INTERRUPTCHAR} ({PageRef Fn INTERRUPTCHAR}).Note:  In Interlisp-D with multiple processes, it is not sufficient to say that "the computation" is broken, aborted, etc; it is necessary to specify which process is being acted upon.  Most of the interrupt characters below refer to the TTY process, which is the one currently receiving keyboard input.  Control-H can be used to break arbitrary processes.  For more information, see {PageRef Tag ProcessInterrupts}.{Begin LabeledList interrupt characters currently enabled in Interlisp-D}{Indent 15percent}{Name control-B{index control-B}}{Text Causes a break within the TTY process.  Use control-H to break a particular process.Note that this break occurs at the next function call, so it is like control-H in Interlisp-10; it is always safe to resume the computation.  There is no interrupt character like control-B in Interlisp-10}{Name control-C{index control-C}}{Text On the Xerox 1100 and Xerox 1132, brings the user into the Raid low-level debugger.  From Raid, typing control-N resumes the Lisp computation, and control-D resets the stack.  On the Xerox 1108, after typing control-C, the system stops and waits for the next character typed.  Pressing the {lisp STOP} key will do a {lisp HARDRESET}, returning control to the user.  Pressing the {lisp UNDO} key will start up the TeleRaid debugger.}{Name control-D{index control-D}}{Text Aborts the TTY process, and unwinds its stack to the top level.  Calls {fn RESET} ({PageRef Fn RESET}).}{Name control-E{index control-E}}{Text Aborts the TTY process, and unwinds its stack to the last {fn ERRORSET}.  Calls {fn ERROR!} ({PageRef Fn ERROR!}).}{Name control-H{index control-H}}{Text Pops up a menu listing all of the currently-running processes.  Selecting one of the processes will cause the break to take place in that process.}{Name control-P{index control-P}}{Text Changes the {fn PRINTLEVEL} setting, as described on {PageRef Fn PRINTLEVEL}.}{Name control-T{index control-T}}{Text Prints status information for the TTY process.}{End LabeledList interrupt characters currently enabled in Interlisp-D}{note add something about SHIFT-SHIFT-CTRL-DEL emergency call to RAID --Ron}Note:  The control-O,{index control-O} and control-S{index control-S} interrupt characters from the Tenex version of Interlisp-10 are not enabled in Interlisp-D.  }{End SubSec Interlisp-D Interrupt Characters}{Include IDdiff}{Include IDfiles}{Include IDhardcopy}{Include IDperformance}{Include Proc}{Include Promptforword}}{End Chapter Interlisp-D Specifics}</pre>
