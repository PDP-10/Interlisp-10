Text is selected with the mouse, and all editor operations act on the current selection.There are two ways to start TEdit:  With an explicit call to the function \lisp{}TEDIT\rm{}, or from the background menu. At top level, you can call\lisp{}{\nofill{}(TEDIT \arg{}TEXT\lisp{} \arg{}WINDOW\lisp{})\par}\rm{}where \arg{}TEXT\rm{}  is the thing you want to edit, and \arg{}WINDOW\rm{} is an optional argument specifying the window you want to do the editing in.  To start a fresh editing window, specify a \arg{}TEXT\rm{} of \lisp{}NIL\rm{}.  Otherwise, \arg{}TEXT\rm{} may be the name of an existing file, a string to be edited, or an arbitrary [\lisp{}MKSTRING\rm{}-able] Lisp object.The text is displayed in an editing window, and may be edited there (see below).  There will be a one-line-high prompting window across the top of the editing window; it is used to ask for file names, search strings, and the like.The \lisp{}TEdit\rm{} option in the background menu opens an empty editing window; you may either type in the text you want, or use the \lisp{}Put\rm{} menu option (below) to bring in a file.\vskip10pt\bf{}\noindent\save0\hbox{1.1}\ifdimen 1wd0>30pt{\box0\hskip10pt }\else{\hbox to 40pt{\vbox{\box0}\hfill}}Selecting Text\rm{}\penalty 2000\penalty 2000\mark{Selecting Text}\penalty 2000\vskip10pt\penalty 2000TEdit works by operating on {\lquotes}selected{\rquotes} pieces of text.  Selected text is highlighted in some way, and may have a caret flashing at one end.  Insertions go where the caret is; deletion and other operations are applied to the currently selected text.Text is selected using the mouse.  There are two regions within an edit window:  The area containing text, and a {\lquotes}line bar{\rquotes} just inside the left edge of the window.    While the mouse is inside the text region, the cursor is the normal up-and-left pointing arrow.  When the cursor moves into the line bar, it changes to an up-and-right pointing arrow.  Which region the mouse is in determines what kind of selection happens:The \lisp{}LEFT\rm{} mouse button always selects the smallest things.  In the text region, it selects the character you're pointing at; in the line bar, it selects the single line you're pointing at.The \lisp{}MIDDLE\rm{} mouse button selects larger things.  In the text region, it selects the word the cursor is over, and in the line bar it selects the paragraph the cursor is next to.The \lisp{}RIGHT\rm{} button always extends a selection.  The current selection is extended to include the character{\char'57}word{\char'57}line{\char'57}paragraph you are now pointing at.  For example, if the existing selection was a whole-word selection, the extended selection will also consist of whole words.There are special ways of selecting text which carry an implicit command with them:If you hold the \lisp{}CTRL\rm{} key down while selecting text, the text will be shown white-on-black.  When you release the \lisp{}CTRL\rm{} key, the selected text will be deleted. You can abort a \lisp{}CTRL\rm{}-selection:  Hold down a mouse button, and release the \lisp{}CTRL\rm{} key.  Then release the mouse button.Holding the \lisp{}SHIFT\rm{} key down while making a selection causes it to be a {\lquotes}copy-source{\rquotes} selection.  A copy source is marked with a dashed underline.  Whatever is selected as a copy source when the \lisp{}SHIFT\rm{} key is released will be copied to where the caret is.  This even works to copy text from one edit window to another. You can abort a copy:  Hold down a mouse button, and release the \lisp{}SHIFT\rm{} key.  Then release the mouse button.Holding the \lisp{}CTRL\rm{} and \lisp{}SHIFT\rm{} keys down while making a selection causes it to be a {\lquotes}move{\rquotes} selection, which is marked by making it veverse video.  Whatever is selected as a {\lquotes}move{\rquotes} source when the \lisp{}CTRL\rm{} and \lisp{}SHIFT\rm{} keys are released will be moved to where the caret is.  This even works to move text from one edit window to another. You can abort a move:  Hold down a mouse button, and release the \lisp{}CTRL\rm{} and \lisp{}SHIFT\rm{} keys.  Then release the mouse button.  If the variable \lisp{}TEDIT.EXTEND.PENDING.DELETE\rm{} is non-\lisp{}NIL\rm{}, extending a selection will display the selection as white-on-black.  The next time something is typed (or if text is copied or moved there), the inverted text will be deleted first.  This provides an easy way of replacing text.\vskip10pt\bf{}\noindent\save0\hbox{1.2}\ifdimen 1wd0>30pt{\box0\hskip10pt }\else{\hbox to 40pt{\vbox{\box0}\hfill}}Editing Operations\rm{}\penalty 2000\penalty 2000\mark{Editing Operations}\penalty 2000\vskip10pt\penalty 2000Inserting text:  Except for command characters, whatever is typed on the keyboard gets inserted where the caret is.  The \lisp{}BS\rm{} key and control-A both act as a backspace, deleting the character just before the caret.  Control-W is the backspace-word command.Deleting Text:  Hitting the \lisp{}DEL\rm{} key causes the currently-selected text to be deleted.  Alternatively, you can use the \lisp{}CTRL\rm{}-selection method described above.Copying Text:  Use \lisp{}SHIFT\rm{}-selection, as described above.Moving Text:  Use \lisp{}CTRL\rm{}-\lisp{}SHIFT\rm{}-selection.Undoing an edit operation:  The top blank key is the \lisp{}Undo\rm{} key (the \lisp{}KEYBOARD\rm{} key on the 1108).  It will undo the most recent edit command.  \lisp{}Undo\rm{} is itself undo-able, so you can never back up more than a single command.Redoing an edit operation:  The \lisp{}ESC\rm{} key is the \lisp{}Redo\rm{} key (the forward-arrow key on the 1108).  It will redo the most recent edit command on the current selection.  For example, if you insert some text, then select elsewhere, hitting \lisp{}ESC\rm{} will insert a copy of the text in the new place also.  If the last command was a delete, \lisp{}Redo\rm{} will delete the currently-selected text; if it was a font change, the same change will be applied to the current selection.The command menu:  You can get command menus by moving into the edit window's title region and hitting the \lisp{}RIGHT\rm{} or \lisp{}MIDDLE\rm{} mouse buttons.  \lisp{}RIGHT\rm{} gets the usual menu of window commands.  \lisp{}MIDDLE\rm{} gets a menu of editor commands:\vskip 10pt\vskip-10pt\parshape 1   92pt  370pt {}\save0\hbox{\lisp{}Put\rm{}}\noindent\ifdimen 1wd0>82pt{\hskip-92pt\box0\hskip0pt plus 1000pt\linebreak\null}\else{\hbox to 0pt{\hskip-92pt\box0\hskip0pt plus 1000pt minus 1000pt}}Causes an updated version of the file to be written.

If you specify a server name, the hardcopy will be sent there.  If you leave the brackets empty, TEdit uses \lisp{}DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST\rm{} as usual.  You may also specify how many copies of the document you want; if you don't put anything in the {\lquotes}copies{\rquotes} field, you get one copy.The \lisp{}Quit\rm{}, \lisp{}ParaLooks\rm{}, \lisp{}CharLooks\rm{}, \lisp{}PageLayout\rm{}, and \lisp{}All\rm{} buttons need no additional arguments.  \lisp{}Quit\rm{} stops the current editing session; \lisp{}All\rm{} causes the entire document to be selected.

The menu will be filled in to match that text's looks.  You can then \lisp{}APPLY\rm{} it elsewhere, perhaps after modifying things slightly.The second line of the menu is a list of character properties which can be modified independently.  Each of the menu buttons has three states:  If the button appears white-on-black, that property will be turned on; If the button appears with a diagonal line, that property will be turned off; If the button appears black-on-white, that property will be left alone.Why is it useful to leave a property alone?  Suppose you have a paragraph in Times Roman with some bold and some italic in it.  If you want to change the font to Helvetica without changing the boldness or italicness, you can do so.The third line of the menu is a list of font-family names.  You can select among them: selecting one family deselects any others.  You can also select no family by mouse buttoning between two of the families.  If you \lisp{}APPLY\rm{} with no font family selected, the text will be left in whatever font family it was.The \lisp{}Other\rm{} choice in the font-family selection lets you add new fonts to the menu.  To pick a family that isn't offered in the menu, first type the name between the brackets after (rm other font  Then pick \lisp{}Other\rm{} as the font family.  Then next time you \lisp{}APPLY\rm{} the menu, the new font family will be applied to the text you've selected, and the family name will be added to the menu.The last line of the menu lets you set the font's size, and specify any superscripting or subscripting.  Fill in the {\lquotes}Size:{\rquotes} field with a number, and \lisp{}APPLY\rm{}ing will change all the selected characters to that size.  Leave it empty, and the characters will retain their existing sizes.For character offsets, you have three choices:  Normal characters lie on the baseline; Superscript characters lie above the baseline by the distance you specify (2 points by default); Subscript characters lie below the baseline by the distance you specify (2 points by default).  As with font family names, you may mouse in the space between options to neutralize the choice.  \lisp{}APPLY\rm{}ing with a neutral choice leaves characters with the super- and subscripting they had, if any.\vskip10pt\bf{}\noindent\save0\hbox{1.4}\ifdimen 1wd0>30pt{\box0\hskip10pt }\else{\hbox to 40pt{\vbox{\box0}\hfill}}The TEdit Paragraph Formatting Menu\rm{}\penalty 2000\penalty 2000\mark{The TEdit Paragraph Formatting Menu}\penalty 2000\vskip10pt\penalty 2000The Paragraph Looks Menu looks like this:\lisp{}{\nofill{}Paragraph Looks Menu:     APPLY    SHOWLeft  Right  Centered  Justified    Page Heading \rm{}type:  \lisp{} {\char'173}{\char'175}\rm{}Line leading:\lisp{}  {\char'173}{\char'175}  \rm{}Paragraph leading:\lisp{}  {\char'173}{\char'175}\rm{}New Page:  \lisp{} Before   After\rm{}Tab Type:\lisp{}  Left Right Centered Decimal   \rm{}Default Tab Size:\lisp{}  {\char'173}{\char'175}\par}\rm{}Below this menu is a solid black rectangle, used for setting indentations, and a ruler, used for setting tab stops.As with the Character Looks Menu, you select the text you want to change, set the entries in this menu up as you want the text to appear, then make the change by hitting the \lisp{}APPLY\rm{} button.If you have a paragraph whose looks you want to copy, select the text and hit the \lisp{}SHOW\rm{} button.  The menu will be filled in to match that text's looks.  You can then \lisp{}APPLY\rm{} it elsewhere, perhaps after modifying things slightly.The second line of the menu is for specifying how the paragraph margins are to be justified.  A Left justified paragraph has a ragged right margin, but is justified flush with the left margin.  A Right justified paragraph has a  ragged left margin, but is justified flush on the right.  A Centered paragraph is centered between the two margins.  A Justified paragraph is set flush with both the left and right margins.On that line, you may also declare this paragraph to be a page heading (see the Page Layout Menu section), and say what kind of heading it is.  The \lisp{}Page Heading\rm{} button is an On-Off-Neutral button; depending on its setting, it will make the paragraph be a page heading, make it stop being a page heading, or leave it alone.The space between lines in a paragraph is called {\lquotes}line leading{\rquotes}.  You can specify it, in units of printer's points.  You can also leave space in front of a paragraph (without using extra carriage returns) by specifying {\lquotes}paragraph leading,{\rquotes} also in units of printer's points.You may ask that a new page (or column, if you're using multiple columns to the page) be started either before or after this paragraph.  These are controlled by the \lisp{}Before\rm{} and \lisp{}After\rm{} buttons, respectively.  These are also 3-state buttons, and can be used to set and reset the new-page property or leave it alone.  Generally,You set paragraph margins using the margin ruler on the bottom.  There are three margin values:  The left margin for the paragraph's first line, the left margin for the rest of the paragraph, and the paragraph's right margin.  The margin ruler is has three sensitive areas, one for each margin value.  Margins are measured in printer's picas (6 to the inch), with a grain of 1{\char'57}2 pica.  There are 12 points to the pica.  Plans exist for allowing different units (and granularity) in the ruler.The first-line left margin is controlled by the top half of the ruler, left end.  To move it, push a mouse button near the left edge, and hold it.  Moving the mouse pulls the margin along with it; the margin ruler always shows the current values of the margins.  If you push the \lisp{}RIGHT\rm{} mouse button over the margin, it becomes neutral; i.e., \lisp{}APPLY\rm{}ing the paragraph menu won't change the first-line left margins of any paragraphs.The rest-of-paragraph left margin is controlled by the bottom half of the ruler, left end.  You move it (and neutralize it) the same way.Likewise for the right margin, which is controlled by the right end of the margin ruler.  There are a couple of differences here.  First, you can set the right margin to 0, which will create a {\lquotes}floating{\rquotes} right margin (one that follows the right edge of the edit window or of the printed page).  This is signalled by a margin ruler that is as wide as the window, but shows a value of 0 at its right end.Since the editing window may be narrower than the document, you can also set the right margin beyond the edge of the window, by pulling it with the mouse, and pulling past the window edge.  A right margin you can't see is represented by a double wavy line at the right edge.To make a margin {\lquotes}neutral{\rquotes}, so that \lisp{}APPLY\rm{}ing it won't change that margin setting, move the margin with the right mouse button.  The margin will become gray, to indicate that it is neutralized.You can also set tab stops using the margin ruler.  The space below the ruler markings is sensitive to all three mouse buttons, and is used to represent tab stops. To set a tab, you first need to choose what kind of tab you want, using  the line starting with {\lquotes}Tab Type:.{\rquotes}  Make your choice of tab type the same way you'd choose a font family.  Left tabs are regular typewriter type tabs; Right tabs take the succeeding text and push it so it is flush-right against the tab stop location; Centered tabs cause the succeeding text to be centered about the tab stop; Decimal tabs (not implemented) cause the succeeding text to have its decimal point lined up on the tab stop.  Tab stops are shown in the margin ruler as small arrows with suggestive tails.To create a new tab stop, use the middle mouse button.  In the region below the ruler markings (and the numbers!), point to where you want the tab to be, and press the middle mouse button.

For each class of page, you may specify separate layout and headings.Specify which class of page you are setting up on the second line of the menu, by choosing one of the options \lisp{}First(&Default)\rm{}, \lisp{}Other Left\rm{} or \lisp{}Other Right\rm{}.  If you want the entire document laid out uniformly, you need only set up (and APPLY) parameters for the first page.If you want to modify an existing page layout, choose the page class you want to modify and hit the \lisp{}SHOW\rm{} button.  The menu will be filled in from the existing layout specifications.When you have the menu set up as you want the layout to be, hit the \lisp{}APPLY\rm{} button, and your specifications will be saved as part of the document.  There will be no noticible change in the document---page layout only happens when a document is hardcopied.SETTING UP PAGE NUMBERS:	A given class of pages may or may not have page numbers.  Set this by choosing one of the buttons \lisp{}Yes\rm{} or \lisp{}No\rm{} on the {\lquotes}Page Numbers{\rquotes} line.  If you decide to have page numbers, you must specify where you want them.  The \lisp{}X\rm{} and \lisp{}Y\rm{} fill-in blanks let you do this.  Specify the page number's location as distances from the lower, left corner of the paper; the distances are measured in picas (6 to the inch).Next, you must specify how to align the page number with the location you specified.  If you specify \lisp{}Left\rm{} alignment, the left edge of the page number will print at the location you gave; \lisp{}Centered\rm{} alignment centers the page number at the spot you specified; \lisp{}Right\rm{} alignment puts the right edgge of the page number at the location you specified.  Suppose you want to have page numbers lined up against the page's margin, toward the outside edge of each page.  Then you would specify \lisp{}Right\rm{} alignment for recto pages and \lisp{}Left\rm{} alignment for verso pages.SETTING UP PAGE HEADINGS:	You may have up to four kinds of page headings{\char'57}footings on any page. (This limit will be relaxed in the future).  For each type, specify a name (which must be a \lisp{}LITATOM\rm{}), and a location for the left end of the topmost line of text in the heading.Within text, headings appear as separate paragraphs.  Use the {\lquotes}Paragraph Looks{\rquotes} menu to declare that a paragraph is to be a page heading.  You will have to fill in the {\lquotes}heading type{\rquotes} field with the same name you used in the {\lquotes}Heading Type{\rquotes} field in this menu.SETTING CHARACTER LOOKS FOR PAGE NUMBERS:	The page layout menu has a special section for setting the character looks used to print page numbers.  Set the looks just as you would set regular character looks; the settings you give will take effect when you \lisp{}APPLY\rm{} the page layout menu.\vfill\eject\def\noheaderonce{T}\bf{}\noindent\save0\hbox{2}\ifdimen 1wd0>30pt{\box0\hskip10pt }\else{\hbox to 40pt{\vbox{\box0}\hfill}}TEDIT FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE\rm{}\penalty 2000\penalty 2000\mark{TEDIT FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE}\penalty 2000\vskip10pt\penalty 2000The top-level entry to TEdit is:\vskip 10pt\formatdef{462pt}{\lisp{}(TEDIT \arg{}TEXT WINDOW DONTSPAWN PROPS\lisp{})\arg{}\lisp{}\rm{}}{Function}\penalty 2000\vskip-10pt\penalty 2000\parshape 1   92pt  370pt {}\noindent \arg{}TEXT\rm{} may be a (litatom) file name, an open \lisp{}STREAM\rm{}, a string, or an arbitrary [\lisp{}MKSTRING\rm{}-able] Lisp object.
