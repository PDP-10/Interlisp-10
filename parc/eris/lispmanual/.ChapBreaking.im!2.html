Interlisp provides several different facilities for doing this.  By "breaking" a function, the user can cause breaks to occur at various times in the running of an incomplete program, so that the program state can be inspected.  "Tracing" a function causes information to be printed every time the function is entered or exited.  These are very useful debugging tools."Advising" is a facility for specifying longer-term function modifications.  Even system functions can be changed through advising.{Include BreakFns}{Include Advising}}{End Chapter Breaking, Tracing, and Advising}</pre>
