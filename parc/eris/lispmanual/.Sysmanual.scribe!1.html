It has a 600 by 800 point bitmapped display, a local diskdrive, and a connection to the experimental 3 Megabit Ethernet.  The Altoserved as the basis for all facets of Xerox's personal workstationdevelopment including processor, software, and perhaps most importantly,Ethernet development.  The Altos are comparatively slow machines, but theyare still around, and the software developed for them is still in use inmachines which emulate Altos.)  and the Mesa and Interlisp VirtualMachines.  The Dolphin is equipped with a 23 megabyte Winchester disk forlocal storage, a 1024 by 808 bitmapped display, a 3 megabit Ethernetinterface and at least 2304 512-byte pages of MOS memory (with a largevirtual address space).This manual will discuss the responsibilities of the site manager for aDolphin installation running the Interlisp-D language.  Interlisp-D is theimplementation of the Interlisp language for the Xerox's D-series machines(this includes the Dolphin, the Dorado, and future processors).  @comment{TheDandelion is one, but Xerox won't let me admit that}Interlisp-D is fullycompatible with Interlisp-10 and Interlisp-VAX, but has the added power ofbitmapped display graphics not available in these other Interlispimplementations.In addition, the Interlisp-D I/O system makes full use of the capabilities ofEthernet file transfer protocols.  Files can reside either on the local diskor on a file server accessible via the Ethernet.  Paged andrandom-access I/O can be performed on both local and remote files.@section(Other References)This guide provides only a cursory overview of the Alto operating system, anddoes not attempt to describe Interlisp at all.  For more complete informationon the Alto system, refer to @I&lt;The Alto User's Handbook&gt;.  Interlisp isdocumented in @I(The Interlisp Reference Manual).  Those parts of Interlisp-Dnot defined in the basic Interlisp language are documented in the@I&lt;Interlisp-D Users Guide&gt;.  An excellent introduction to the L@c&lt;ISP&gt;language is found in @I&lt;LISP&gt;, by Patrick Winston and Berthold KlausPaul Horn.  The 3 mbit/sec Ethernet is documented in a number of Xeroxinternal memos, as well as a small number of published papers.  Xeroxshould be able to supply copies of these papers.@Chapter(The Dolphin Hardware)The configuration of a Dolphin running Interlisp-D typically contains:@begin(itemize)The processor, containing ALU, control store, memory controller,miscellaneous functions, memory, disk, terminal, and Ethernet interfaceboards.The local disk, currently a Shugart 4008 Winchester-style disk.The keyboard, display, and mouse.  The display is a 1024 by 808 bitmaparranged in landscape (horizontal) mode.  The mouse is a pointing deviceto aid in interactive graphical programming.@end(itemize)Dolphins come in three styles depending on their vintage of production.  Theoriginal Dolphins were built at Xerox PARC and are encased in Alto boxes.These are small units with the Shugart disk built-in, and invisible from theoutside.  The "pre-production" Dolphins were built at Xerox's El Segundoplant and are actually the front end processors for their 5700 serieslaser printers.  These are larger, louder machines, with the Shugart diskplaced in its own box sitting on top of the processor box.  Finally, theproduction model Dolphins are once again small units (smaller than the PARCmodels) with carefully designed acoustical padding to make them acceptable inan office setting.Despite their varied appearances, however, all Dolphins are electrically andoperationally compatible.  Most PC boards and all programs can be swappedbetween units.@section(@ixi(The processor box))The Dolphin's @ixi(central processor) is composed of four boards: the@ixi(control store), @ixi(ALU), @ixi(miscellaneous functions), and@ixi(memory controller) boards.  These boards always occupy the first fourslots in the motherboard.@foot(Far right on the pre-production model, lookinginto the back of the unit; top-to-bottom on the production units.)See figure @ref(backplane).@begin(fullpagefigure)@blankspace(8 in)@caption(Backplane configuration for pre-production and production Dolphins)@tag(backplane)@end(fullpagefigure)Furthermore, each board has a specific slot within these four locations, andis keyed to prevent its being installed in the wrong slot.  The rest of thePC boards can go almost anywhere in the motherboard (memory boards mustreside in slots 5-12) so long as no gaps exist between boards.The front panel of the processor box contains the ON/BOOT and OFF switches,as well as a 4 LED maintenance panel.  The ON/BOOT switch turns the processoron, and later (on a second push) boots the processor, once the disk haswarmed up.  The @ixi(maintenance panel) (@ixi(MP)) displays various informationabout the state of the processor.  The meanings of the various numbers aredetailed in Appendix @ref(MPCodes).  When the processor is first booted, theMP displays the number of pages of physical memory available.  While runningInterlisp, the MP displays a cumulative count of page faults since startingInterlisp.@foot(This may have changed by the time you read this document.)In the following, references to the tops and bottoms of the PC boards are meaningful for the pre-production model of the Dolphin, in which the boardsare mounted vertically from the rear of the processor box.The @ixi(rigid disk controller) (@ixi(RDC)) board allows the Shugart disk toemulate a dual model 44 Diablo disk.  This permits software developed for theAlto to be used with the Dolphin.  There are two cables linking the RDC boardwith the disk.  The cable terminated in the small plug is plugged into theupper of the two small sockets on the rear of the board.The @ixi(terminal controller board) (@ixi(UTVFC) in Xerox terminology) linksthe keyboard and display with the processor.  The cable to the display shouldbe plugged into the topmost of the four sockets on the board.  The displaycan be as far as 250 feet from the processor.There are usually six @ixi(memory boards), each containing 96K 16-bit wordsof memory.  When the Dolphin is booted, the maintenance panel on the front ofthe Dolphin records the number of pages of memory available.  This shouldread at least 2304.  If less than that (frequently in quanta of 384 pages,the capacity of one memory board), at least one memory board is failing.Interlisp-D can usually run with 1920 pages of memory (one memory boardfailing), but its performance will be poor.  The Dolphin can be configuredwith a maximum of eight memory boards.  As you might expect, its performancewill be better with more physical memory.The @ixi(Ethernet Interface) connects the Dolphin to a 3 Megabit Ethernet.There is a single cable leading from the interface to the Ethernettransceiver.  This cable can be about 40 feet long.A typical procedure for tracking down hardware failures is to swap PC boardswith a working Dolphin.  Make sure the processor is powered @b&lt;off&gt; whenchanging boards; severe component damage will result if you do not.@section(The Keyboard, Display, and Mouse)The keyboard/display/mouse station is linked to the processor via a seventwisted-pair cable.  As previously noted, this cable can be up to 250 feetlong; however, at these distances, the screen image may be corrupted by linenoise.  If you attempt to remote the display by this much, you must adhere tothe cable specifications as provided by Xerox; a low-loss, high bandwidthcable is required.  Be sure you have not crossed the twisted pairs; to do sosometimes produces quite a pyrotechnic display behind the screen!If you remote the @ixi(display unit), you may have to adjust a timing delaycircuit located inside the display base.  To do this, remove the back of thedisplay base.  Attached to the back is a small PC board labelled "7-WireInterface."  Sitting on top of the PC board is an ungainly LRC circuit.  Thiscircuit must be adjusted to match the characteristics of the cable betweenthe display and the processor.  If misadjusted, the display will appear tofragment.  Adjust the variable capacitor until the screen image appears wholeagain.  Once you reassemble the display, you may find the adjustment of theLRC is off slightly due to its being installed within the base; if thishappens, try again.  The @ixi(mouse) is a useful device which permits the user to point to anylocation on the screen.  The mouse currently in use has a large steel ball onits underside.  Motions of the mouse across a surface are translated into Xand Y components and then transmitted to the processor.  The mouse performsbest if placed on an unpolished surface.  Paper is generally not a goodsurface to run the mouse on, though, since paper fibers can jam up theprecision mechanism inside the mouse.  The best surface is a thick rubber mat(Xerox calls them "mouse traps").The @ixi(keyboard) is a 63 key unencoded keypad.  Because the keyboard isunencoded, the Dolphin can read any number of keys simultaneously, and alsogive arbitrary meaning to any key.  Within Interlisp-D, however, the keyboardis treated like a standard CRT keyboard.  Notice the set of three unlabeled keys on the right side of the keypad.  Thelowest key is known as the @ixi(SWAT) key, and when used in conjunction withthe left SHIFT or CONTROL key, allow you to interrupt Interlisp and return tothe Alto operating system or enter the Alto debugger respectively.  This isnot a good idea, as you may destroy the Interlisp environment, but you mayneed to resort to this in case of software or hardware problems which hangInterlisp.@section(The Local Disk)The @ixi(local disk) is built into the processor box on the PARC and productionmodel Dolphins, and sits on top of the processor box in the pre-productionmodels.  As mentioned above, there are two cables running from the disk tothe disk controller in the processor.  A third cable connects to a powersupply within the processor, as well.  The disk should be maintenance free,however, you may need to replace a disk which has developed hard disk errors,rendering it unsafe to use.@subsection(Replacing a Disk)To replace a disk, first unplug all cables leading to it.  Gain access to thetop of the disk (remove the cover of the disk box on the pre-productionmodel).  There are two locking devices you must install before moving thedisk.  The first of these is a head restraint.  There should be a plastic"fork" in or near the Dolphin.  This should be placed under the head motiondamper (the circular fixture at the rear of the disk with the yellow cautionlabels) around the head pivot to prevent the heads from moving duringtransport.  Do this while the disk is powered up.@foot(Yes, powered-up!.Shugart says that while spinning, the head floats above the disk, and it isimpossible to damage the head in case inserting the damper restraint causesthe head to move.)  The second lock is a small screw which locks the beltdrive, preventing the disk from spinning.  There is a yellow caution labelwith an arrow pointing to the place where the screw goes (on the blackplastic guard surrounding the drive belt).  Rotate the drive pulley by hand(clockwise only!) until the screw hole comes into view.  Install the screwand tighten until firm.To remove the disk from its box, unplug all cables leading from the diskfixture to the box, and loosen the screws on the four legs which fix the diskto its case.  Remove the disk and put the replacement disk in its place.Connect the necessary plugs, remove the drive locking screw and the headdamper lock, and plug the cables from the disk drive into the processor.  Putthe cover back on.  Power the Dolphin up and listen for the usual sounds ofthe disk drive.  If things sounds wrong, double check what you've done, andcall Xerox if necessary.  If the disk sounds OK, you may still have toreinstall the Interlisp software.  See page @pageref(LispInstall).@chapter(The Alto Software)Dolphin software falls into two categories: that which is necessary to runthe Alto emulator, and that which is necessary to run Interlisp.  Afreshly-booted Dolphin runs an Alto emulator.  The Alto emulator is necessarybecause many of the lowest-levels of I/O in the Interlisp environment rely onBCPL routines written for the Alto.  When running only the Alto emulator, thedisplay will appear narrow, masked to the dimensions of an Alto screen.  TheAlto also provides a filesystem.  In the Dolphin, your filesystem appears tospread over two separate partitions of a dual Diablo model 44 disk drive.The two disk partitions are isolated from one another; to switch betweenpartitions, give the @ixi(Partition.~) command (e.g. type @B(Partition 1) or@B(Partition 2)).The Alto command processor (the @ixi(Alto Executive)) has a syntaxreminiscent of the Tenex/Tops-20 Exec.  Interlisp users should have littleuse for the Alto emulator, aside from starting Interlisp, but the Dolphinsite manager should be familiar with the Alto Executive and operating system,as several diagnostics (notably disk diagnostics) must be invoked using Altocommands.@section(Alto Executive Commands)Commands to the Alto Executive can be abbreviated, and recognition isavailable using the ESC key.  File names and commands are treated identicallyby the command processor.  There are no special characters in Alto filenames; ``.'' has no significance in a file name.  However, commands to theAlto Executive are signified by ending in ``.~'' (i.e. Copy.~).  Filenamesand commands can be a mixture of upper and lower case; however, all commandand filename lookup is done in a case independent manner.  Whenentering commands or file names, several special characters can be typed:@begin(description, indent -.5 in)?@\Type out file names or commands which fit the partial name/command typedin so far.  Return to command/file name input afterwards.TAB@\Like ``?,'' except that the command input buffer is cleared afterlisting the file names or commands which match what had been typed in.TAB typed to a blank field is the way to see the names of all the files onthe disk and all the Executive commands.&uarr;X@\Control-X.  Expands any wildcards entered so far, replacing them by all the file names which fit the wildcard mask.  For instance, iffiles F@C&lt;OO1&gt; and F@C&lt;OO2&gt; exist, and you type "D@C&lt;ELETE&gt; @C&lt;FOO*&gt;"followed by &uarr;X, the command line is replaced by D@C&lt;ELETE&gt; F@C&lt;OO1&gt; F@C&lt;OO2&gt;,allowing you to abort the command in case a file you didn't mean to delete isamong the wildcard group.DEL@\Aborts the command, returns to command input.  Like &uarr;U on Tops-20, DELon vanilla Tenex, &uarr;X on Sumex Tenex, etc.BS@\Backspaces one character.ESC@\Attempts to recognize and complete input typed so far.  If ambiguous,fills out as far as it can.@end(description)@flushleft(Alto Executive commands to know:)@begin(description)@ixi(Copy.~)@\Copies a file on the disk.  The syntax is @b&lt;not&gt;Tenex/Tops-20-like.  To copy a file, type @b&lt;Copy.~ @p&lt;NewFileName&gt;@value(leftarrow) @p&lt;OldFileName&gt;&gt;.@ixi(Delete.~)@\Deletes files on the disk.  Type one or more filenames,separated by spaces: @B&lt;Delete.~ @P&lt;file1 file2&gt; ...etc... @p&lt;fileN&gt;&gt;.@begin(multiple)@ixi(Install.~)@\Causes the Alto operating system to enter a reconfigurationdialogue.  The ``short dialogue'' allows you to set a default username, adisk name, and whether a password is needed to use the machine.  The diskname should identify which partition of the disk is in use (i.e. callpartition one @b(Partition 1) and partition two @B(Partition 2)).  Dolphinusers may desire that a password be set to prevent unauthorized use of themachine.  You should know these passwords in case you have to diagnosefailures when no one who knows the passwords is around.The long installation dialogue allows you to erase the disk and completelyreinstall the Alto and Interlisp systems.  This may have to be doneperiodically when new releases of Interlisp come out, as well as when you areinstalling a new disk.  The long installation dialogue cannot be performedunless you have another Dolphin accessible over the Ethernet running the AltoFTP program, or unless you have access to a larger file server running programs compatible with the Xerox 3 Megabit PUP software (specifically, theByte Stream Protocol based File Transfer Protocol).  Appendix@ref(LispInstall) contains the long install procedure.@end(multiple)@ixi(Login.~)@\Tells the Alto operating system your name and password. Interlisp-D uses this when it attempts to do file transfers over theEthernet.  If you forget to login at the Alto level, there is a L@c&lt;OGIN&gt;function in Interlisp to do the same thing.  If you are reinitializingInterlisp (see page @pageref(LispSlashI)), you should give the Login.~command first so that Interlisp knows whose INIT.LISP file to look at whenrunning the G@c&lt;REET&gt; function.NetExec.~@index(NetExec)@\If your Dolphins are connected to a 3 MegabitEthernet which has a file server with net boot capabilities, you can give theNetExec command.  This causes the Dolphin to boot the NetExec, a specialnetwork-oriented Executive stored on the file server.  The NetExec in turnlets you boot other programs from the file server.  The NetExec gives youaccess to diagnostics (DiEx, CRTTest, KeyTest) and filesystem verificationand repair programs (Scavenger) you may need to keep your Dolphins running.@ixi(Partition.~)@\Allows you to switch between partitions of thedisk.@ixi(Rename.~)@\Renames a file on the disk.  The syntax is like Copy.~ (seeabove).@ixi(Scavenger.~)@\Boots the Scavenger program via the Ethernet.  Scavengeris a filesystem repair program which can undo damage caused by a crash.Instructions on its use are in @I&lt;The Interlisp-D User's Guide&gt;.@end(description)@section(Alto Files and Programs)There are a number of files critical to the operation of the Alto emulatorand Alto operating system.  If any of these files are deleted, you won't beable to boot your Dolphin.  This can be an insurmountable problem if youdon't have the necessary 3 Megabit software running on your file server toreinitialize the Alto software from scratch.@flushleft(Files needed for the Alto OS:)@begin(description)@ixi(DiskDescriptor.)@\Defines the filesystem format.@ixi(Executive.Run)@\This is the Alto command processor.@ixi(Swat.)@\This is the Alto debugger.  A crashed Alto usually ends up inSwat, giving you some indication of what went wrong (i.e. disk error,trap instruction, etc).@ixi(Swat.Help)@\A list of Swat commands, readable by Swat, giving you onlinehelp when you type ``?.''@ixi(Sys.Boot)@\This is the Alto operating system.@ixi(Sys.Errors)@\A text file used by Swat to translate between internal errornumbers and human readable messages.@ixi(SysFont.al)@\.AL files are font files for Altos.  SysFont.al is the font usedby the Executive and other Alto programs.@ixi(User.cm)@\A text file, defining preferences for various user-settable optionsin the Executive and other Alto programs.@end(description)Alto programs come in two flavors, @ixi(run files) and @ixi(boot files).  Runfiles can be invoked from the Alto Executive.  They usually have the .Runextension, and when you quit from such a program, you are returned to theExecutive.  To invoke a run file, type its name to the Alto Executive,followed by any optional arguments (see the reference to CreateFile.Run, forinstance, on page @pageref(createfile)).Boot files, on the other hand, cannot be invoked directly from the AltoExecutive (they can on an Alto, but the Dolphin has the wrong type of disk forthe Alto Bootfrom.~ command to work).  Boot files can be invoked by theNetExec, though (see above).  When a program in a boot file quits, it usuallyreturns you to the NetExec program.  As their name might suggest, boot filesreplace the entire Alto operating system.  Any information you've told theAlto operating system about yourself (i.e. your name, using the Login.~command) is lost when you run a boot file.  To invoke a boot file, type itsname to the NetExec program.  You cannot supply arguments with a boot file,however.In the list below, programs available only as run files or boot files are soindicated by their extension; programs available in both forms are listedwithout any extensions in their names.@flushleft(Useful Alto Programs:)@begin(description)@ixi(Chat)@\The Alto virtual terminal program.  You may have this program(you will if you are at a University Grant site or you've convinced Xerox tolet you have it) or you may not.  There's also DMChat, which simulates a 60line high Datamedia 2500 CRT.@ixi(Createfile.Run)@\Creates big empty files using contiguous disk space.This is the way to create Interlisp-D's virtual memory buffer when you arereinstalling the interlisp-D system.@ixi(CRTTest.Boot)@\Useful for checking display linearity.  Type anycharacter to switch to the next sized grid.@ixi(DiEx.Boot)@label(Diex)@\The Diablo disk exerciser.  Run this program ifyou suspect disk problems.  DiEx has many options which can be set byselecting an option with the mouse and entering new values.  For mostpurposes, it suffices to set the disk type to Diablo 44 (point to @b(Type:Mod-31) and press the left mouse button), initialize (point to @B(InitVerify) and press the left mouse button), and run the test (point to @B(DoTest) and press a mouse button).  DiEx will report hard and soft disk errors,giving their sector, track, and head numbers.  For more customized diagnosis,look at some of the other menu items in DiEx (they are self-documenting;simply point at an item with the mouse, and read the message in the messagewindow).  A more rigorous diagnostic is available in the BFSTest program,documented in Appendix @ref(LispInstall).@ixi(FTP)@\The Alto BSP based file transfer program.  If you have Chat, you'llprobably have FTP.  If your file server isn't running a reliable Leaf server,it may be running a reliable FTP server (implementations exist for Tenex,Tops-20, and Unix, as well as for the Xerox Alto-based Interim File Server).@ixi(InstallSwat.Run)@\Reinstalls the Alto debugger.  You must run this aftererasing the disk with the long installation dialogue.@ixi(KeyTest.Boot)@\Useful for checking the keyboard.  Self-explanatory.@ixi(Scavenger)@begin(multiple)@\Scavenger is a file system repair program.When your Dolphin falls into Swat with an error message telling you thatthere's something wrong with the disk, try running Scavenger.  Scavengertakes about 5 minutes to run.  When it's done, it leaves a log calledScavenger.Log$ telling you what it's done, and creates a file calledScavenger.Garbage$ which contains "incorrigible disk pages."  You may deleteScavenger.Garbage$ with the Delete.~ command.  If your disk has hard readerrors (caused perhaps by surface damage on the disk), Scavenger will map them out of existence.@foot(Sites running a Scavenger predating May 12, 1982should ask for an update.)@end(multiple)@end(description)@section(The Alto Net Boot Procedure)This information is included for sites with 3 megabit Ethernet softwarewishing to add or understand the Alto net boot protocol.  The Alto netbootstrap does the following:@begin(enumerate)Broadcasts a @I&lt;MayDay&gt; Pup to all miscellaneous service sockets on theconnected network.  The ID field of the Pup contains the boot file number ofthe file to be booted.Becomes an EFTP receiver.  A server which receives the @I&lt;MayDay&gt; request andcan satisfy it opens an EFTP socket, and begins sending the boot file to theAlto or Dolphin.  If two servers or more can satisfy a boot request, thebootee locks onto the first one which responds, and ignores all others (spacelimitations within the Alto prevented the inclusion of code to send @I&lt;Abort&gt;Pups to other responding servers); the other servers will eventually timeout.@end(enumerate)Of course, the above description presupposes an Ethernet bootstrap in memory.This may not be the case.  It is possible to boot an Alto or Dolphin with ablank memory (i.e. one which has no working disk to load a bootstrap from) bymeans of the @I&lt;Breath-of-Life&gt; mechanism.  Every five seconds, aBreath-of-Life server will broadcast a special packet (not a Pup, but a rawEthernet packet of type 602@C&lt;B&gt;, directed to host 377@C&lt;B&gt;).  An Alto orDolphin wishing to be booted will copy this packet into main memory, startingat location 1, and begins executing code starting at location 3.  The packetmay be no longer than 254 words plus 2 words of Ethernet encapsulation.@I&lt;Breath-of-Life&gt; is a block of Alto code which supplies enoughinformation for the Alto or Dolphin to read the next block of code, which isfound on the second page of the boot file.  From there, an EFTP connectionserves to transfer the rest of the boot file from the server to the Alto orDolphin, where packets are copied into main memory.Even with the limited program space in the Alto bootstrap, it is possible toselect which boot file you wish loaded.  When the bootstrap starts, it readsa value from the unencoded keyboard, and places that value in the ID field ofthe MayDay Pup.  Certain keyboard combinations are well known: holding downthe BS key enables Ethernet booting; if BS is the only key held, boot file 0(DMT, the dyanamic memory test) will be loaded; if BS and ' (Quote) are helddown, boot file 10, the NetExec, will be loaded.When booting a Dolphin, the mechanism becomes even more complex, asAlto-emulator microcode must be loaded.  When the Dolphin has a working disk,this micrcode is loaded from a set of special tracks shared betweenpartitions, and not writeable during normal operations.  When the Dolphin hasno disk (or the disk hasn't warmed up yet), it tries to load microcode fromthe Ethernet.  This @I&lt;microcode boot&gt; is similar to an Alto net boot, exceptthat instead of using EFTP to move the microcode, the microcode boot serversimply sends the code in Pups one after another, without waiting foracknowledgement.The Tenex/Tops-20 Pup server job has the ability to perform both Alto-styleand microcode-style boots, but @B&lt;cannot&gt; send @I&lt;Breath-of-Life&gt; packets(Tenex/Tops-20 Pup service can send only Pups).  The VAX/Unix Pup servicecurrently supports @I&lt;Breath-of-Life&gt; and Alto boot, and should be able tosupport microcode boot with minimal effort.@chapter(The Interlisp-D Software)The Interlisp-D environment is comprised of a number of files.  Chief amongthese are the Interlisp microcode loader, bootstrap, sysout, and virtualmemory buffer.  There are a number of ancillary files, such as Interlisp-Dfont files and Lispusers packages.To run Interlisp, first boot the Dolphin.  When the Alto emulator is running,and you're looking at the narrow Alto screen, run the programDolphinLispMC.Run.  This loads the Interlisp microcode.  As a result, thescreen expands to its full width, and the Alto Executive returns.  You maynow start Interlisp-D.  If Interlisp has been used before in this partition,the file Lisp.VirtualMem contains a runnable image of Interlisp, and bytyping @b(Lisp), you will restart this image.  If Lisp.VirtualMem is empty(Lisp has never been run before, or you've just refreshed the disk), type@b(Lisp/i).  This causes the Lisp bootstrap (Lisp.run) to fill Lisp.VirtualMemwith a runnable image of Interlisp taken from the Interlisp sysout file,Lisp.sysout.Lisp takes a minute or so to load.  When it's ready, you'll by sitting atInterlisp's top level, E@c(VALQT).  To leave Interlisp, evaluate the functionL@c&lt;OGOUT&gt;.  The next time you start Lisp, you'll be returned to the Interlispenvironment at the point you logged out.@section(Files Needed to Run Interlisp-D)The following is a list of files which must reside on your disk to runInterlisp-D:@begin(description)@ixi(DolphinLispMC.Run)@\A runnable program in Alto operating system formatwhich loads the Interlisp microcode.@ixi(Init.Lisp)@\Interlisp-D configuration file.  Defines the search path forLispusers directories, user greetfiles directories, etc.  Read when theG@c&lt;REET&gt; function is evaluated.  This file is comparable to the site Init.Lispin Interlisp-10.@begin(multiple)@ixi(Lisp.Run)@\The Interlisp-D bootstrap program, again an Alto formatrunnable file.  If you type @b(Lisp) to the Alto Executive, Interlisp-D willbe started from the environment stored in Lisp.VirtualMem.  This is the wayto continue an Interlisp session ended by L@c&lt;OGOUT&gt;.@label(LispSlashI)If you type @B(Lisp/i) to the Alto Executive, the Interlisp environment will beloaded anew from Lisp.sysout.  This is the way to reinitialize Interlisp-D.This takes a bit of time, however, so be patient.  When the hourglass cursorreaches the bottom of the screen, initialization is complete.If you type @B(Lisp @P&lt;filename&gt;), the Interlisp environment is loaded from@I&lt;filename&gt; a file produced by the Interlisp-D S@c&lt;YSOUT&gt; function.  Note: theprevious Interlisp environment stored in Lisp.VirtualMem will be lost.  Ifyour fileserver has a 3 Megabit Ethernet BSP-based FTP server, you can load asysout over the Ethernet by typing @B(Lisp @p&lt;{hostname}filename&gt;), where@I&lt;hostname&gt; is your file server's name on the Ethernet.@end(multiple)@ixi(Lisp.Syms)@\An Alto-format symbol file for Lisp.Run.  If your Dolphinfalls into Swat, you may be able to continue running Lisp by calling RAIDfrom Swat.  To do so, type @B(Raid&uarr;C) (Raid followed by &uarr;C) to Swat.  Thefirst time you enter Swat, however, Lisp's symbols may be unknown.  To makethem known to Swat, type @B(&uarr;YLisp.Syms@value(downcurve)).@ixi(Lisp.Sysout)@\The basic Interlisp environment, used to initializeLisp.VirtualMem.@ixi(Lisp.VirtualMem)@\The virtual memory buffer.  This file should be 8000decimal pages long, and works best when allocated contiguously.  TheCreatefile program, mentioned above, can be used to create Lisp.VirtualMem.To do so, type @B(Createfile Lisp.VirtualMem 8000D)@label(createfile) to theAlto Executive.  To ensure the availability of 8000 contiguous pages, thisfile is best created after refreshing the disk.@end(description)Files which must be resident on disk or accessible via a file server:@begin(description)*.DCOM@\Compiled Lispusers packages.@index(Lispusers packages)*.Strike@\Interlisp-D font files (Gacha and Helvetica fonts).@index(Displayfonts)@ixi(Fonts.Widths)@\Defines font sizes for Xerox fonts.@end(description)@section(Configuring Interlisp-D)When Interlisp-D is started up for the first time (after reinitialization,for example), it evaluates the G@c&lt;REET&gt; function.

The following procedure will completelyerase your disk partition, and then rewrite the Alto OS, Executive, and FTPprogram.  The Alto files will be FTP'ed from the host you specify in theprocedure.  This can be a large file server, such as an IFS or timesharingmachine running PUP software, or it can be another Dolphin.  If your serverfor this procedure is a Dolphin, then enter a blank line in the questionbelow asking for the name of the directory where Alto files are kept.  In the example below, it is assumed Alto files are kept in a directory named@I&lt;Alto&gt;.  @b(Make absolutely sure all important files are safely stored onanother machine!)The disk refresh procedure requires a server supporting the Alto bootprotocol be running somewhere on your Ethernet.  Some file servers, such as the Sumex-Tenex and DECsystem-20 P@C&lt;UPSRV&gt; program, and the Xerox IFSsupport the Alto boot protocols.  If your file server doesn't, and you haveat least one running Dolphin, you can turn that Dolphin into a boot server byrunning the Peek program on it.  Refer to page @pageref(peeksrv).Before reinstalling a disk partition, you may run an overnight diskexercisor.  This is wise if you suspect hardware problems within the disk.The instructions immediately following this paragraph tell you how to run thedisk exercising program.  If you believe the disk is sound, skip them, andproceed to step 2 for instructions on rewriting a disk partition.  @begin(enumerate)@begin(multiple)To run the exercisor, you need a boot server with BFSTest.boot.  From theAlto executive on the machine you wish to exercise, in the proper partition,type @B(NetExec) to boot the NetExec program.  Then type@B(BFSTest)@index(BFSTest) to invoke the disk exercisor.  Do the following:@begin(programexample)*@b&lt;Partition 1&gt; (or 2, whichever you want done)*@B&lt;Certify&gt;@value(downcurve) How many passes? @B&lt;100&gt; Use both of the disks? @B&lt;Y&gt; Use all 406 cylinders of the disk? @B&lt;Y&gt; Use all 14 sectors of the disk? @B(Y)@end(programexample)	Note: It seems Certify sometimes does not give you the option of 406cylinders, and assumes 203 instead.

If the IFS isn't available, these files can also beretrieved from {S@C[UMEX]-A@C[IM]}&lt;D@C[OLPHIN]&gt;.Retrieve *.S@c[TRIKE] and I@C[NIT].L@C[ISP] from {IFS}&lt;Lispusers&gt;.Confirm that Lisp runs by initializing it via @B(Lisp/i).@end(enumerate)@end(enumerate)@label(peeksrv)If you need to create your own temporary boot server, you can do run the AltoPeek program on another, working, Dolphin.  There are two files you need inaddition to the boot files.  These are Peek.run and PeekUser.cm.  You shouldrename the file User.cm to some other file name (i.e. @B&lt;Rename.~ OUser.cm@value(leftarrow) User.cm&gt;), then @B&lt;copy&gt; PeekUser.cm to be User.cm.  Thenrun the Peek program.  The Dolphin running the server program must have thenecessary boot files on its disk.  For the above procedures, you needNewOS.Boot and BFSTest.Boot.  When you are done, rename OUser.cm back toUser.cm.@appendix(Recovering From Disasters)@label(disaster)@index(Disasters)Sooner or later, someone is going to delete the wrong file, or the disk willdevelop a few hard read errors in the wrong places, or something similar, andyour Dolphin will be unusable.  Typically, you'll boot the machine, themaintenance panel will flash the standard disk boot sequence(40-700-720-etc), but when the Alto-sized display lights up, the cursor won'ttrack with the mouse.  This indicates that the Alto software is hungsomewhere due to a bad or missing file.  Unless you have access to a fileserver with complete booting service (Breath-of-Life and net boot), callXerox.  If you do have booting software on your file server, there is stillhope.The first program to run is @ixi(Scavenger) (the boot file version, ofcourse).  To do this, you must first run the @ixi(NetExec) program.  Sinceyou can't run the Alto Executive to give the NetExec.~ command, you must getNetExec in another way: hold down simultaneously the @B(BS) and @B(') (Quote)keys, and press the boot button (try first the one behind the keyboard, andif that fails, the S@C&lt;TART&gt;/O@C&lt;N&gt; button on the processor's front panel).Continue holding the keys until the Alto-sized screen appears, with a smallrandomly-filled square sitting in the center.  This square represents theacknowledgement packet for the EFTP transaction taking place to boot theDolphin (with NetExec.boot); it is stored in the cursor memory to save oncritically-short memory space during booting.  In short order, the bootingprocess should end, and the NetExec program should start.  Select the faultypartition with the NetExec's @B(Partition.~) command, and type@B&lt;Scavenger&gt;@value(Downcurve), and the booting process should repeat itself,completing this time with the Scavenger program running.  Answer Scavenger'squestions and cross your fingers.  If it wants to rewrite a page, let it.On its completion, Scavenger will attempt to boot into the current diskpartition.  If the Dolphin still won't boot, try reinstalling the operating system.  Todo this, obtain the NetExec as described in the previous paragraph, andselect the desired disk partition.  Type @B&lt;NewOS&gt;@value(downcurve), and waitfor the booting to end.  Answer questions as in the following dialogue:@begin(programexample)Do you want to install this operating system? @b(Y)Dov you want the long installation dialogue? @B(N)@end(programexample)Follow the instructions in Appendix @ref(lispinstall) to complete theinstallation.  When NewOS finishes, it should have supplied you with a newoperating system, default font, and Executive.  You may have to repeat theentire procedure a couple of times, in case the disk surface is badlydamaged, and NewOS has trouble finding good pages to install itself on.If you still can't get the Dolphin to boot, reinstall the faulty partition,following the instructions in Appendix @ref(Lispinstall); you probably shouldalso check the condition of the disk with either DiEx (page @pageref(diex))or BFSTest.@appendix(Maintenance Panel Codes)@label(MPCODES)@index(MP)@index(Maintenance Panel)The following is a list of maintenance panel codes transcribed from someunnamed Xerox document.
