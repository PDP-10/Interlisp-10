It is now in use by researchers here at PARC and also at a number of beta-test sites outside of Xerox Corporation.	x4e12jk40We are distributing Loops references and instructional materials in order to assist users of experimental versions of the system.  Feedback from such users is playing an important role in guiding the evolution of the system. 	 x4e12jk40A list of presently available Loops references is enclosed.  A form for selecting materials and a stamped reply-envelope are included for your convenience in ordering items of interest.	x4e12jk40				Sincerely,x4e36jk40(0,65535)(1,65535)(8,12192)x4e24jk40				Mark Stefik					Principal Scientist					Knowledge Systems Area	x4e19jk40x4(635)A LIST OF LOOPS REFERENCES AND RESOURCES FOR KNOWLEDGE PROGRAMMERSl3881d2999x4jk40(2116)\b66BBackground Articles about Loopsl3881d2999x4e24jk40\bi"Knowledge programming in Loops: Report on an experimental course," by Mark Stefik, Daniel Bobrow, Sanjay Mittal, and Lynn Conway.

In the case studies, the assumptions are relaxed one at a time to yield more sophisticated programs with more complex organizations.)	x4e15jk40\200i23I"Towards the principled engineering of knowledge," by Mark Stefik and Lynn Conway.
