The pin expresses our special appreciation for the help you have given us in evaluating our ideas on "knowledge programming".  Loops is measurably improving under the review and suggestions from so many good minds.  x2e12jk40The logo is an icon for our principle that programming paradigms must be integrated.  Different paradigms are for different purposes. Each colored region stands for one of the Loops paradigms.  In Loops, the paradigms are not just complementary, they are designed to be used together.  This is the meaning of the rings in the logo. x2e12jk40At this point, 50 people have taken the Loops course, built their small knowledge systems, and entered a knowledge competition.  We are enclosing an article about the knowledge competition by Paul Wallich, a writer from the IEEE.  He captures much that we feel is important about Loops.x2e12jk40We are now seriously considering the possibility of making Loops into a product, and also considering the possibilities for licensing it to other computer vendors.  News on this will be forthcoming over the next few months.  Another 50 or so people will be taking in courses in June and July.  We are in the middle of plans for August.  We hope to be able to run some Loops courses in the Washington area, and also to run some knowledge competitions at the AAAI.  x2e12jk40Thank you again for your participation in the course.  We enjoyed working with you, and also enjoyed watching the knowledge competitions.  We are also creating a Loops button, like one for a political campaign.  We plan to give those away at AAAI.  However, the Loops pin is only being given to people who have taken the Loops course, and have thus helped to shape our experiment in new methods.x2e12jk175\168i6ISincerely,l11040e36jk40(0,65535)(1,65535)(8,12192)The Loops TeamDanny, Sanjay, & Markl11040e43jk40e12jk40(8,13208)
