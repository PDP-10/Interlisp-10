LABELThis implements the LABEL construct of Lisp 1.5, permitting inline specification of recursive functions.  (LABEL name args . forms)can be used inline in place of an open lambda.  The difference isthat forms may contain (lexically, not hidden under a macro) forms thatlook like calls to a function name (e.g. (name a b)).  Thesecalls will apply (recursively) the function specified by the LABEL.Currently this is implemented by binding name as a variable with valuethe lambda expression (LAMBDA args . forms), except that (name a b) formsare converted to (APPLY* name a b) and (FUNCTION name) forms are converted tojust name.LABEL requires and will load the LAMBDATRAN package.----Comments to Larry Masinter (or Ron Kaplan)</pre>
