HOW TO USE A FINISHED SKETCH6You can use a finished sketch either by itself or to illustrate a TEdit document.  This chapter first describes how to save, retrieve, and print an individual sketch.  It then explains the special features of using a sketch in a TEdit document.  Detailed information on using TEdit can be found in the TEdit documentation in the Lisp Library Packages Manual.       2To Use a Sketch by Itself1To Save a Sketch in a File1To save a sketch, first select the Put command.  A small window with the text ©©File to PUT to:¹¹ will appear above the sketch window.  The caret will be flashing in it.  Type the name of the file that you want the sketch saved in.  When finished, type a carriage return.  After you type the carriage return, the name of the new file followed by ellipses will be printed in the window.  When the file is finished, the message ©©Done¹¹ will appear.If you got this sketch from a file, or if you have saved it before, that file name will appear in the small window with the caret at the end.  If you want to use the same file name, just type a carriage return.  If you want to change the file name, type the new name; the old one will be automatically erased.  You can also backspace over part of the file name.To Retrieve a Sketch From a File1Select the Get command.   A small window with the text ©©File to GET from:¹¹ will appear above the sketch window.  The caret will be flashing in it.  Type the name of the file that you want to get.  When finished, type a carriage return.If there are elements in the sketch when the Get command is executed, the sketch on the file will be added to them.  The grid and default settings that control how new elements appear (see the section ©©To Change the Way New Elements Look¹¹) are saved with a sketch and will be restored when the sketch is retrieved.If your window is empty after getting a sketch, the sketch window is viewing a portion of your sketch that doesn't contain anything.  (Chapter 5,  ©©How to Manipulate the Sketch Display,¹¹ may help you understand what has happened.)  Either the current sketch window or the sketch window from which the sketch was put was scrolled or zoomed.  Your sketch hasn't been lost, it's just outside the view of this window.  Use the Fit It command (see the section ©©To Get an Overview of the Sketch¹¹)  to move the window to where your sketch is.To Print a Sketch1 To Send a Sketch to a Printer1Move the cursor into the title bar of the sketch window and press the right button.  Select the Hardcopy command from the menu that appears.  The image of what you see in the window will be sent to your default printer, the same size as it appears on the screen, centered on the page.  If you want to send it to another printer, slide out the right of the Hardcopy command and select the To a Printer item.  You will be offered a menu of the known printers and the option of typing in the name of a new one.To Get a Whole Sketch on the Printer11Move the cursor over the Hardcopy command, press the left button, and slide out the right side through the triangle.  A menu containing, among other things, the item Whole Sketch will appear.  Select the Whole Sketch item.  The entire sketch will be printed on your default printer at the size it appears in the window.  If the sketch is too large to fit on one page, multiple pages will be printed, leaving margins large enough to allow them to be taped together.  Warning: it is very easy to use lots of paper with this command by printing the whole sketch from a window that is zoomed in.To Make the Screen Fonts Agree With Printed Copy1Move the cursor over the Hardcopy command, press the left button, and slide out the right side through the triangle.  A menu containing, among other things, the item Hardcopy Display will appear.  Select the Hardcopy Display item.  This will cause the text to be displayed as close as possible to the way it will look when printed.  Because text fonts have significantly different widths on the display than on printers, the Hardcopy Display command is useful when you are trying to align text and graphics.  The first time you apply this command, there may be a delay while Sketch finds the necessary font information.  To return to normal character display mode, select the item Normal Display from the menu that contained the Hardcopy Display item.To Make a Printer File to Use Later1Move the cursor into the title bar of the sketch window and press the right button.  Slide out the right of the Hardcopy command and select the To a File item from the menu that appears.  A small window with the text ©©File name: (CR to abort)¹¹ will appear above the sketch window.  The caret will be flashing in it.  Type the name of the file that you want the sketch printer image saved on.  When finished, type a carriage return; the name of the new file followed by ellipses will be printed in the window.  When the file is finished, the text ©©Done¹¹ will appear.  Note:  a file made this way does not save the sketch in a way that allows you to modify it, just an image that your printer can process.  To save the sketch itself, see the section ©©To Save a Sketch in a File.¹¹2To Use a Sketch in a Document11To Put a Sketch Into a Document 1You can include a sketch in a TEdit document by copy-selection.  Select the location in the document where the sketch is to go.  Hold down the copy-select key.  Move the cursor into the sketch window and select the pieces of the sketch to be inserted.  The whole sketch can be selected by double-clicking on a sketch element.  While selecting pieces, the right button removes elements from the selection.  When the desired elements have been selected, release the copy-select key.  The sketch is inserted into the document; it will be sized to fit the selected elements.  The copy-selection process can be aborted by moving the cursor outside the sketch window while a button is down. The sketch is adjusted so that the lower-left corner of the inserted sketch is on a grid point.  This is done so that when the sketch is edited, the grid remains aligned with existing points.  The grid can be made smaller before the copy-insertion to reduce the amount of adjustment.Note:  you must have Sketch loaded to edit or look at a TEdit document that has a sketch in it.  If Sketch isn't loaded, the document will contain an icon that says ©©Undefined image object with GETFN SKIO.GETFN.2.¹¹  Quit this TEdit, load Sketch, and call TEdit on the document again.  Also, TEdit will display a sketch only if the TEdit window is at least as tall as the sketch.To Edit a Sketch That Is in a Document  1You can edit a sketch in a TEdit document by pressing the left button in it and selecting the item Edit Sketch from the menu that appears.  This opens a sketch window the same size as the sketch in the document.  If the TEdit window buries your sketch window, move the TEdit window to another position and click on the sketch window to make it active.  When you are finished editing the sketch, close the window (see ©©To Stop Sketch¹¹); you will be asked whether to put the changes into the document the sketch came from. To Change the Size of a Sketch in a Document  1Open a sketch window onto the sketch by using the procedure described above.  Reshape the sketch window to the desired size and shape.  Close the sketch window.  The sketch size will be changed to the new sketch window size.  It's easier to obtain a particular shape by closing the sketch command menu first.  That way, the prompted-for shape will not include the menu.To Center a Sketch in a Document  1The easiest way to center a sketch in a document is to put it in a paragraph by itself (i.e., have a carriage return immediately preceding and immediately following the sketch), and then use the TEdit paragraph center justification.  You can also use the paragraph leading command to leave white space in front of the sketch. To Copy the Text From a Sketch Into a Document as Characters  1To get just the text out of a sketch as characters (i.e., not as a sketch) use the procedure described in the section ©©To Put a Sketch Into a Document,¹¹ but do all element selection with the middle button.  When you release the copy key, the text in the selected text and text box elements will be inserted as characters.     (LIST ((PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC) STARTINGPAGE# 69) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (270 12 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGR) (54 27 558 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (54 54 504 723) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC)) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD LEFT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (54 12 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGV) (54 27 558 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE VERSOHEAD) (54 762 558 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (54 54 504 684) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC)) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (270 12 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGR) (54 27 558 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE RECTOHEAD) (54 762 558 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (54 54 504 684) NIL)))))       ) Ì Ìø k                       T     )    ø 
