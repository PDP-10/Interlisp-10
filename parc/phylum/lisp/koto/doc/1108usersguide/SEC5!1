SOFTWARE INSTALLATION62Introduction1The installation of software on the Xerox 1108 is a three-step process:1. 	The rigid disk must be partitioned into logical volumes.2.	The SystemTools volume must be loaded with utility software for running diagnostic tests and initializing the local disk with Lisp software. 3. 	Each Lisp volume must be initialized with Interlisp-D in the form of a fresh Interlisp-D sysout. As the Xerox 1108 arrives prepartitioned and preloaded with utility software,  you are normally only concerned with the last of these three steps.However, under certain circumstances, i.e., an "intentional" disk partitioning or a "catastrophic error," it is necessary to repartition the rigid disk and reinstall utility software on the SystemTools volume.  This chapter describes the entire installation process in detail.   Users without network service should read the section that follows.  If you are on the network, proceed to the section entitled  Partitioning the Rigid Disk.2Setting Date and Time on Stand-Alone Work Stations1Xerox 1108 software is designed to accept date and time information automatically from the network. If time service is not available,  or if the Xerox 1108 is not on a network,  date and time must be set manually. This can be accomplished by using the SETTIME function when Interlisp-D is running, or by 2-booting either the Installation Utility floppy or the Fixed Disk Diagnostic floppy and responding to the prompts for date and time. Using the SETTIME Function to Set Time1To call SETTIME when Interlisp-D is running, type	(SETTIME "9-APR-84  10:44:00")If date and time are not set (e.g., after powering up the Xerox 1108), certain system functions may pause indefinitely, waiting for this information to arrive over the network. For instance, when 1-booting, the boot process will suspend itself, with 0937 displayed in the Maintenance Panel. If no time service is available, date and time must be supplied manually, as described above.In general, the recommended mode of operation for systems without time service is to power up the Xerox 1108 into Lisp, set time and date with SETTIME, and eventually LOGOUT into the base state. This should avoid the 0937 pause.Note:	Time information is not maintained when the machine is powered down.Using the Installation Utility Floppy to Set Time1TIME ZONE OFFSETS	-12:	(ocean)	-11:	Nome, Alaska	-10:	Honolulu, Hawaii	-9:	Marquesas Islands	-8:	Los Angeles,California	-7:	Denver, Colorado	-6:	Chicago, Illinois	-5:	New York, New York	-4:	Buenes Aires	-3:	Brazil	-2:	Greenland	-1:	Cape Verde Islands	0:	Greenwich, England	1:	Paris, France	2:	Helsinki	3:	Moscow, U.S.S.R.	4:	Teheran, Iran	5:	Sverdlovsk	6:	Tashkent	7:	Novosibirsk,U.S.S.R.	8:	Hong Kong	9:	Tokyo, Japan	10:	Vladivostok,U.S.S.R.	11:	Caroline Islands	12:	Anadyr, U.S.S.R.It is necessary for users that are not on a network to set the time after booting the Installation Utility floppy. You will be prompted as follows:Time zone offset from Greenwich  (-12 - 12): 	 Enter the appropriate value.Minute offset (0..59): 	 Enter 0 and  press <RETURN>First day of daylight savings time (0-366):	 Enter 121 and press <RETURN>Last day of daylight savings time (0-366): 	Enter 305 and  press <RETURN>Please enter date and time: 	Enter date and time in the format shown	month/day/year hours:minutes:seconds	For example, 3/15/84 15:42:00Set time to March 15, 1984 3:42 PMDo you wish to change the time? 	 Respond by typing Y or N.2Partitioning the Rigid Disk1The Xerox 1108 comes with the disk appropriately partitioned for your disk configuration.  Only in the event of a catastrophic error or an alternate disk partitioning will it be necessary to repartition the disk before reloading the Interlisp-D software.The Xerox 1108 is equipped with a 10, 29, 42 or 80 Megabyte local rigid disk.  The disk is pre-partitioned with multiple logical volumes, depending on the disk size.  The 10 Mb disk is partitioned into 3 logical volumes named SystemTools, LispFiles and Lisp. The 29, 42 and 80 Mb disks are partitioned into a subset of the following logical volumes:  SystemTools, Lisp, Lisp2, Lisp3,Lisp4, LispFiles and LispFiles2.	The SystemTools logical volume utilizes 3500 pages (1 page = 512 bytes) and contains the Profile Tool, the On-line Diagnostics Tool, and the Lisp SystemTool for:·	Installing Interlisp-D on the local rigid disk·	Moving between Interlisp-D volumes on the 	local diskThe logical volumes Lisp, Lisp1, Lisp2, Lisp3 and Lisp4 can each contain a complete Interlisp-D environment.  Each volume holds the Lisp virtual memory which is initialized from the floppy disks, file server, or another Lisp volume on the local disk.Standard Disk Partitions1The table below shows standard disk configurations (in pages)  for each type of rigid disk.	SystemMB	Tools	Lisp	Lisp2	Lisp3	Lisp4	LispFiles	LispFiles210	3500	11189	N/A	N/A	N/A	1500	N/A29	3500	16200	N/A	N/A	N/A	25097	N/A	3500	16200	16200	N/A	N/A	8896	N/A43	3500	16200	16200	8000	N/A	21375	N/A	3500	32500	16200	8000	N/A	5024	N/A80	3500	65000	16200	16200	8000	15000	7086	3500	32500	32500	32500	8000	15000	7086	Non-Standard Disk Partitions1You have the option of specifying non-standard partition volumes and sizes, using the Make Script! command of the Lisp SystemTool window.  (see chapter 6, SystemTools).  This adds an entry to the Installation Utility disk, giving the additional option in the Installation Utility Menu of "USER SPECIFIED PARTITION".  Selecting this option will install the user defined partition.	Partitioning Instructions1When it becomes necessary to repartition the disk:1. 	Boot the floppy labeled 			¹¹Installation Utility©© (using a 2-boot).	If your 1108 is not on a network, you will be prompted to set the time.  See the section entitled Setting the  Time on Stand-alone Works Stations  for details.2.	Select the menu item appropriate for partitioning your particular rigid disk.3.	You will be warned that the PARTITIONING OPERATION DESTROYS THE CONTENTS OF THE DISK.  When asked to confirm, respond by typing Y.4.	When the Installation menu reappears, you may proceed with the next section. Your disk is now repartitioned.  If you created a LispFiles volume, remember to install a Lisp directory using a (CREATEDSKDIRECTORY   'LispFiles)  once you have booted your Lisp volume.Reinstalling Utility Software on the System Tools Volume1The Xerox 1108 comes with the Utility software appropriately installed on the SystemTools volume.  When it becomes necessary to reinstall the Utility software, and once the rigid disk is partitioned, obtain the floppy disks labeled 'Installation Utility' and 'System Files' distributed with the Interlisp-D software kit.1.	If an installation menu is not currently displayed,  boot the floppy labeled Installation Utility, using a 2-boot.  After about 2 minutes, a menu of utility options will be displayed.	If your 1108 is not on a network, you will be prompted to set the time.  See the procedures for  setting the time on stand-alone workstations for details.2.	Select the Menu item "Initialize SystemTools". The LISP microcode will be installed and you will be prompted to insert the floppy disk labeled System Files.  Insert the System Files disk and the SystemTools volume will be installed in a few minutes.3.	At this point, you are ready to load the Lisp SystemTool software.  Choose the menu option Boot  Volume for System Tool!.4.	After about 2 minutes, the cursor will change to a pointing arrow.  Activate the Executive window by positioning the cursor over the letters 'cut' within the word 'Executive' in the small window in the bottom left hand corner of the screen and press the left mouse button.  This will cause the small window to expand to a large window. Press any mouse key when the cursor is inside of the large window to activate type-in to that window.5.	Unload the floppy drive and insert the Installation Utility floppy selected.6.	Type in:     floppy read init.cm <RETURN>.7.	Type @init.cm <RETURN>.  After about one minute the bouncing white rectangle should appear on your display.  At this point, you are ready to use the Profile Tool to create the necessary site-specific file that provides information used by the Lisp SystemTool.8.	Press both left and right mouse buttons (or the middle button on an optical mouse) to activate the Profile Tool.  Fill in the appropriate values for the various parameters. If your 1108 is attached to a Xerox NS Clearinghouse, you must set the Domain: and Organization: parameters to the names defined in your Clearinghouse data base.   Users without an NS Clearinghouse may set these parameters to any reasonable name or may leave them as they are. You do not have to supply values for all parameters in the window.  In particular, if a password is supplied, it is stored on the disk in an unencrypted form.  The Profile Tool supplies default values for the various fields in the Lisp SystemTool.  See the description of the Profile Tool for details.9.	After setting the appropriate parameters, execute the Set Profile! command. Confirm with the left mouse button. When the word "Done" appears in the window, select Quit!.  The Profile Tool window will disappear and you will return to the bouncing white rectangle.  At this point, you are ready to install Interlisp-D software on your Lisp volume(s).The Lisp SystemTool, loaded during the Utility Software Installation phase, allows you to install Interlisp-D software.The tool is activated when you have a bouncing white rectangle on your screen, meaning you're in the base state.  If you cannot enter the base state with a 1-boot, then make sure you have installed the Utility software correctly, especially steps 8 and 9.2Installing Interlisp-D/Starting a Lisp Volume1There are three ways to install Interlisp-D software on a Lisp volume.  You may install from floppy disks, from your file server, or from another logical volume on your local disk. These are described below:Installing Interlisp-D from Floppy Disks1You may install Interlisp-D in the form of the Interlisp sysout from the floppies distributed with the Interlisp-D software kit.To do so: 1.	From the Base State (bouncing rectangle) press the left mouse button to enter the Lisp SystemTool.2.	Point the cursor to Device:  "FLOPPY" and press the left mouse button.  The File: parameter should now contain "Lisp.sysout".  If the sysout on Floppy has another name you can change it by pointing to it, pressing the left mouse button and typing in the correct name.  Sysouts created by the Sysout! command will have the name "Lisp.sysout" as will the sysout on Interlisp-D floppies provided with the Installation kit.3.	Now point the cursor to Sysin! and press the left mouse button.  Follow the dialogue to load your Interlisp-D floppies.  The system will ask you to confirm with the left mouse button once you have inserted the proper floppy.4.	Once the installation is complete, select Boot! to boot your fresh Interlisp-D software.	Installing Interlisp-D from a File Server11.	From the base state of the 1108, click the left mouse button to activate the Lisp SystemTool.2.	Fill in the appropriate parameters in the Parameter Subwindow. The File: parameter should be filled in with the file name of the Lisp Sysout to be installed. Note:  The Max VMem Size: must be large 					enough to accommodate the Sysout file 		being installed.	For an IFS, the file pathname is of the form: [Server]<Directory>Subdirectory>FileName.Sysout	For an FS file server, the file pathname is of the form:	(Server:Domain:Organization)/Directory/	Subdirectory/FileName.Sysout3.	Select the Sysin! command and confirm with the left mouse button. Your Command Subwindow is redisplayed with an hour-glass symbol, while the Message Subwindow displays the number of bytes which have been transferred to your disk.  This gives you an idea of the time remaining for the file transfer. This command can be aborted by pressing the STOP key located on the lower right side of the keyboard.4.	When the sysout is installed, "Done" will appear in the Message Subwindow.  Now you may select Quit! to stop the process and return to the base state, or Boot! to enter the Lisp volume and begin Interlisp-D.Installing Interlisp-D from Another Lisp Volume1The Copy VMem!  command of the Lisp SystemTool may be used to install Interlisp-D Software in the form of the Interlisp sysout on a Lisp volume from another Lisp volume already loaded with Interlisp-D.1.	From the base state of the 1108, click the left mouse button to activate the Lisp SystemTool.2.	Select the CopyVMem!  command from the Command Subwindow and confirm with the left mouse button.3.	When a new window appears, select the source and destination volumes as desired.4.	Select the Start! command.2Starting a Logical Volume1There are three methods for starting a logical volume with Interlisp-D software installed.1.	Lisp SystemTool	Set the Volume parameter to the name of the Lisp volume you wish to start. (See the documentation on the Lisp SystemTools in Chapter  6.) Select the Boot! command and and confirm with the left mouse button.2.	0-boot	0-boot your 1108 to bring up the last Lisp Volume entered.  Note:	 Powering up the 1108 is equivalent to 	a 0-boot. 3.	STOP Key	When in the base state and if the Lisp volume is present on your 1108, pressing the STOP key will boot Interlisp-D from this volume. If this volume is not present, the STOP key will have no effect.  Click the left mouse button to activate the Lisp SystemTool.2Starting Interlisp-D1When Interlisp-D is started for the first time on any volume, you may be prompted for a PUP host number. This number is used to identify the 1108 for PUP-based communications of the Ethernet. Type in any octal number in the range 1-255, making sure no other machine on the same net has already been assigned the number. (See chapter 1,  the section entitled The Ethernet for more detail.)If there is no INIT.LISP file stored on the hard disk file system, you will be asked to supply the name of the system Init file. The Init file contains information that configures Interlisp-D for your installation. (See the files INIT.SAMPLE and INIT.NONET-1108 distributed on LispLibrary, for an example.)If you prefer not to specify an Init file, press the carriage return.The first time an Interlisp-D logical volume is started, immediately after partitioning the disk, there is no directory installed on the LispFiles volume so all {DSK} files will be core files.  To create the directory use a (CREATEDSKDIRECTORY  'LispFiles). See Section 4 for a more detailed explanation of the CREATEDSKDIRECTORY function. Some suggestions for using the local file system.1.	Copy selected Lisp Library packages to {DSK}<LISPFILES>LIBRARY> For example,	(COPYFILE  '{FLOPPY}GRAPHER.DCOM '{DSK}<LISPFILES>LIBRARY>GRAPHER.	DCOM) 2.	Copy selected Lisp User packages to {DSK}<LISPFILES>LISPUSER>  For example,	(COPYFILE '{FLOPPY}ANIMATE.DCOM '{DSK}<LISPFILES>LISPUSER>ANIMATE.	DCOM)3.	Copy selected font files to {DSK} <LISPFILES>FONTS>    For example,		(COPYFILE '{FLOPPY}HELVETICA10.DISPLAYFONT  '{DSK}<LISPFILES>FONTS>HELVETICA10. DISPLAYFONT)	(COPYFILE '{FLOPPY}FONTS. WIDTHS '{DSK}<LISPFILES>FONTS>FONTS. WIDTHS)4.	Use File Browser to manipulate files on {DSK}. To use File Browser, be sure FILEBROWSER.DCOM is loaded.  Then do (FILEBROWSER 'LISPUSERS>*) to browse files on subdirectory LISPUSERS>, or (FILEBROWSER '*) to browse all the files on {DSK}<LISPFILES>.5.	Create a copy of {DSK}<LISPFILES> INIT.LISP.  See the INIT package description in the Lisp Library for details.Thereafter, each time a freshly installed Lisp sysout is started, {DSK}<LISPFILES>INIT.LISP will be loaded automatically to configure your Xerox 1108.(This page intentionally left blank)     (LIST ((PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC) STARTINGPAGE# 37) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (180 204 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGR) (144 216 468 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (144 228 324 528) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC)) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD LEFT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (144 204 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGV) (144 216 468 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE VERSOHEAD) (144 756 468 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (144 228 324 510) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC)) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 10 FAMILY MODERN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC)) (180 204 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE FOOTINGR) (144 216 468 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE RECTOHEAD) (144 756 468 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (144 228 324 510) NIL)))))      ' /    D 
