But For all of;;; the Common Lisp's that PCL runs on today, there is a meaningful way to;;; implement this.  WHAT I MEAN IS:;;;;;; I want the body to be evaluated in such a way that no other code that is;;; running PCL can be run during that evaluation.  I agree that the body;;; won't take *long* to evaluate.  That is to say that I will only use;;; without interrupts around small computations.;;;;;; OK?;;;(defmacro without-interrupts (&amp;body body)  `(progn ,.body))  ;;   ;;;;;; Load Time Eval  ;;;;;;;; #, is woefully inadequate.

But this is very expensive, instead what we;;; would like to do is copy the existing compiled code and replace the;;; values of the inline constants with the right new values.;;;;;; Templated functions provide a nice interface to this abstraction of;;; copying an existing compiled function and replacing certain constants;;; with others.  Templated functions are based on the assumption that for;;; any given CommonLisp one of the following is true:;;;   Either:;;;     Funcalling a lexical closure is fast, and lexical variable access;;;     is as fast (or about as fast) in-line constant access.  In this;;;     case we implement templated functions as lexical closures closed;;;     over the constants we want to change from one instance of the;;;     templated function to another.;;;   Or:;;;     Code can be written to take a compiled code object, copy it and;;;     replace references to certain in-line constants with references;;;     to other in-line constants.;;;;;; Actually, I believe that for most Lisp both of the above assumptions are;;; true.  For certain lisps the explicit copy and replace scheme *may be*;;; more efficient but the lexical closure scheme is completely portable and;;; is likely to be more efficient since the lexical closure it returns are;;; likely to share compiled code objects and only have separate lexical;;; environments.;;;;;; Another thing to notice about templated functions is that they provide;;; the modularity to support special objects which a particular;;; implementation's low-level function-calling code might know about.   As;;; an example, when a classical discriminating function is created, the;;; code says "make a classical discriminating function with 1 required;;; arguments". It then uses whatever comes back from the templated function;;; code as the the discriminating function So, a particular port can easily;;; make this return any sort of special data structure instead of one of;;; the lexical closures the portable implementation returns.;;;(defvar *templated-function-types* ())(defmacro define-function-template (name				    template-parameters				    instance-parameters				    &amp;body body)  `(eval-when (compile load eval)     (pushnew ',name *templated-function-types*)     ;; Get rid of all the cached constructors.     (setf (get ',name 'templated-fn-constructors) ())     ;; Now define the constructor constructor.     (setf (get ',name 'templated-fn-params)	   (list* ',template-parameters ',instance-parameters ',body))     (setf (get ',name 'templated-fn-constructor-constructor)	   ,(make-templated-function-constructor-constructor	      template-parameters instance-parameters body))))(defun reset-templated-function-types ()  (dolist (type *templated-function-types*)    (setf (get type 'templated-fn-constructors) ())))(defun get-templated-function-constructor (name &amp;rest template-parameters)  (setq template-parameters (copy-list template-parameters)) ;Groan.  (let ((existing (assoc template-parameters			 (get name 'templated-fn-constructors)			 :test #'equal)))    (if existing	(progn (setf (nth 3 existing) t)	;Mark this constructor as						;having been used.	       (cadr existing))			;And return the actual						;constructor.	(let ((new-constructor		(apply (get name 'templated-fn-constructor-constructor)		       template-parameters)))	  (push (list template-parameters new-constructor 'made-on-the-fly t)		(get name 'templated-fn-constructors))	  new-constructor))))(defmacro pre-make-templated-function-constructor (name						   &amp;rest template-parameters)  (setq template-parameters (copy-list template-parameters))	;Groan.  (let* ((params #-GCLisp (get name 'templated-fn-params)		 #+GCLisp (copy-tree (get name 'templated-fn-params)))	 (template-params (car params))	 (instance-params (cadr params))	 (body (cddr params))	 #+Symbolics	 (dummy-fn-name (gensym))	 (form 	   (progv template-params		  template-parameters	    `(let ((entry		     (or (assoc ',template-parameters 				(get ',name 'templated-fn-constructors)				:test #'equal)			 (let ((new-entry				 (list ',template-parameters () () ())))			   (push new-entry				 (get ',name 'templated-fn-constructors))			   new-entry))))	       (setf (caddr entry) 'pre-made)	       (setf (cadr entry)		     (function (lambda ,(eval instance-params)				 ,(eval (cons 'progn body)))))))))    ;;    ;; This one may be superfluous.    ;;     #+GCLisp (setq form (copy-tree form))    #+Symbolics    `(progn (defun ,dummy-fn-name () ,form)	    (,dummy-fn-name))    #-Symbolics    form))(defun make-templated-function-constructor-constructor (template-params							instance-params							body)  (let ((cc `(function	       (lambda ,template-params		 (compile () (list 'lambda ,instance-params ,@body))))))    #+GCLisp (copy-tree cc)    #-GCLisp cc))(defun record-definition (type spec &amp;rest args)  (declare (ignore type spec args))  ())</pre>
