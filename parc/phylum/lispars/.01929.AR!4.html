I right-button "shrink" or "close" in it and it shrinks or closes, but then reappears -- with the added feature that it is now the tty window.  No ther window behaves this way that I am aware of.'-----------'Subject': ar1929': right buttoning tty window'To': Jellinek'cc': VanMelle''This does not happen in my system.  Can you get it to repeat?''Given that the tty window is the only one that triggers it, I am disinclined to believe it is a window problem.  I am carboning Bill because it might be something in TTYIN.  Below is the original bug report.  I changed the status of 1929 to incomplete.'richard'-------''Date': 28 Aug 84 21':55 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''I fixed this just in the past week, so I assume Richard is running a more recent loadup.
