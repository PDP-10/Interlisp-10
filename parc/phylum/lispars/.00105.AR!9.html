I used masterscope to ensure that my application (which does add a process) is not binding them.  I checked another lisp users world, these vars are not bound.  I looked at calls of CROCK.PROCESS and \TIMER.PROCESS.  Aside from these I don''t see where these are being bound in my world.   Ideas?''Greg'-----'Date': 16 MAR 84 11':18 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': Re': Lisp': NOW is being bound!'To':   Nuyens, LispSupport'cc':   JONL''In response to the message sent  14 Mar 84 16':03 PST from Nuyens.pa''ABCDATABASE.SYSOUT shows only two funcitons SETting NOW, and both of them'have it boud first.
