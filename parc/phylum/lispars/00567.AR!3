Just load it and call (LINES).'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  4-May-84 10':16':06Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: Masinter.paIn/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: LibraryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: FixedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
