I get them when typing caret positioning commands in EMACS.  E.g., after ^P''s, ^N''s, ^E''s, & ^A''s while using EMACS.  I''ve put Frequency = Intermittent, but I would guess 50% (the half of the time the caret is up).''Date': 11 May 84 10':42 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''Caretology has substantially changed since Apr 26, and I can''t reproduce this in the latest sysout.  So I''m declining this AR.  Feel free to reopen it if you have this problem in the new sysout.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 11-May-84 10':49':21
