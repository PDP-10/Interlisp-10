Number: 1284Date:  1-Jun-84 11':02':34Submitter: Le.pasaSource: Raim.pasaSubject:  Fixed Disk Diagnostic erases local file system volumesLisp Version: CarolDescription: ''DLion file system defines volume {DSK} in such a way that  it appears to be erased when EI Fixed Disk Diagnostic is run.  Currently, DLion customers are urged to run the Fixed Disk Diagnostic routinely when the DLion exhibits any suspicious behavior.  The implication is DLion faults cannot be diagnosed unless all of {dsk} is first backedup.

This destroys any information on DLionFS disk volumes.  This should be documented in the Carol Release.'''     ----- Forwarded Messages -----''Date': 22 May 84 17':14 PDT'From': stansbury.pa'Subject': dlionfs'To': Sannella, Purcell'cc': stansbury.pa''Seems that the fixed disk diagnostic floppy provided to every customer wipes lisp logical volumes clean.  Should be some warning in the documentation to that effect.''-- T.'''Date': 22 MAY 84 18':02 PDT'From': PURCELL.PA'Subject': Re': dlionfs'To':   stansbury, Sannella, Purcell'' In response to the message sent 22 MAY 1984 1715-PDT by stansbury.pa''Wow. Definitely warn users about diagnostics wiping volumes clean.
