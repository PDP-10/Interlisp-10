COPYFILE to an NS file server breaks with error message "SPP Retransmit Queue out of order".   (Dering.pasa) COPYFILE to {DSK} device on 1108  and then an IFS completes without reported error,  but the sysout cannot be installed.   The Interlisp-D screen comes up but then the machine falls into 9004.  (Dering.pasa , Syntelligence) COPYFILE to DEC20 file system completes without reported error, but the system falls into RAID after initialization with the message "Error in uninterruptable system code".   (Schlumberger) COPYFILE to a Dolphin in FTPServer mode completes, but again falls into RAID immediately after initializtion.  (Teknowledge': Backtrace unavailable at this time)''It is possible to copy the file to disk in Tajo environment, and then use the file tool to transfer the file to an NS file server.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-Aug-84 20':36':21</pre>
