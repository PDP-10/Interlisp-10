When I''m finished reading message X and proceed to delete it, message X+1 is automatically displayed (in general, a very nice feature).  However, if in the heading of X+1 I see it''s just junk mail that''s 200K chars long which I definitely want to skip, I cannot do so, and am forced to *wait* until the displaying of X+1 is finished.  (Unless I ^E out or something).''	Laurel didn''t seem to have the waiting problem.   Are the (system) printing/displaying times that different?   Did it only attempt to display that portion of the message that would actually appear on the screen?''curiously,'Dan''[bvm -- yes, tedit has to see the end of the message before it can display any of it]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-May-84 16':30':51
