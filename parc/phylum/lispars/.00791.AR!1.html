Number: 791Date: 23-Apr-84 14':20':10Submitter: Sannella.PASource: vanMelle.paSubject: Want to cancel crtl and/or shift selection by moving mouse out of windowLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 19 Apr 84 19':24 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': TEdit': Want better way to cancel ctrl and/or shift selection'To': TEditSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa''TEdit System Date': 13-Apr-84 11':44':53'Lisp System Date': 16-Apr-84 11':25':02'Machine': Dorado (Archimedes)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': Always'Impact': Annoying''It sure would be nice if a selection with ctrl and/or shift down could be canceled by rolling out of the window.  There are several reasons for wanting this':''1) It is a popular way of canceling a selection.  Observe TTYIN, DEDIT, INSPECT, Lafite browser, almost any menu': if you roll out of the window with your button still down, the program pretends you never even started to make the selection (well almost; the inspector ends up canceling any previous selection as well; TTYIN lets you roll out the bottom without canceling).''2) The current method is confusing.  I have to think about my hand/mouse coordination more closely than I would like.''3) The current method sometimes gets in my way when I didn''t want to cancel.  In particular, I have found that about a quarter of the time that I perform a quick ctrl-select on a single character somewhere, the character doesn''t get deleted, apparently because I let up on ctrl before letting up on the mouse.''4) The current method changes the point of insertion when you cancel.  This ranges from being a minor nuisance in common cases, to being exceedingly obnoxious if my insertion point was far away in the document, to rather confusing if my tty was elsewhere and I was trying to cancel a copy-select--canceling it has the side effect of changing the tty process!''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
