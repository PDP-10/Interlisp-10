The way things are now, if you try to hardcopy a large message file, you''re in danger of running out of array space.  Of course, this is true also if you fix TEDIT.HARDCOPY, since the TEDIT.INCLUDE that Lafite uses to compose the textstream also copies into core, but at least you could hardcopy something about twice as big with the same impact on array space.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalskyEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 16':38':01</pre>
