It seems to be real.  Somewhere in the file system, it doesn''t like having a subdirectory and name specified that way "ARI&gt;DAVIS".''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: vanMelle, KaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
