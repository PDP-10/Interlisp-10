Lisp users at Xerox will continue to submit bug reports to LispSupport/1100Support. (Users and implementors with access to Tajo/Mesa can use ARSubmit to submit bug reports directly.) All users will be encouraged to supply information requested by ARSubmit (System/Subsystem, Impact, Frequency, Lisp Version, etc.)Releases defined via AR numbers: release held until all AR's marked "Absolutely" are fixed.Developers will inform (LispSupport  / 1100Support) of all visible changes to Interlisp-D, even if they fix bugs that have not been assigned AR numbers. (Give details of what bug got fixed). This is to be included in AR database.Pasadena will handle 1100Support mail, assign AR numbers and send message back  to whomever with AR number. (Possibly could submit AR while on phone to give immediate feedback.) Palo Alto will handle LispSupport mail similarly. We will encourage all customers and non-PARC users to send mail to 1100Support. (Alternative proposal: Pasadena will handle LispSupport.PA, and we set up separate mailbox PARC-LispSupport?)LispSupport.PA will no longer contain LispCore^. A new mailbox, LISPAR.Auto,  has been created and added to LispSupport.The following will be done every day, by someone (rotating assignment):> Retrieve all LispAR.Auto mail.> Enter bug reports into Adobe.> Modify status/disposition fields of old AR's as directed by implementors in messages (e.g., "please change Status of ARxxx to Fixed") .> Forward requests for service, manuals, information, etc. to the appropriate person.>  Back up LispAR mail on Phylum> Weekly, create an updated AR summary report sorted by "system/subsystem" by "status" by "priority", and send to the assignees. (During the experimental period, it is will be necessary to do this more frequently than weekly).LispCore^ members are expected to respond to all ARs: review categories and modify or reassign; and for high priority tasks, either reject them, alter their priority, or fix the problem. Identify "workaround" by AR number.Until Pasadena classification is more stable, we will also, every day, review the classification of bug reports by 1100Support staff, sending them feedback on classification. We will change Lafite LispReport to have the Adobe fields, possibly with pop-up menu choicesDesign discussions to LispCore^, not LispSupport.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Design of lisp based AR tools:Note that all AR's are saved on [phylum]<lispARS> in plain text. AR 23 is stored as [phylum]<LispARS>00023.AR. Editing one makes another version of the same file.Lisp tools to view, sort, and index AR's are thus simple. I don't know whether the same is true about other tools. If they can be done by interacting with Phylum, we can create them. Otherwise, we will need more (probably unavailable) information on the protocol for talking to the librarian.     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----
