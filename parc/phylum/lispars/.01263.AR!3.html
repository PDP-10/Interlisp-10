EVALing local vars in DEDIT evals in a mouse process and so returns NOBIND instead of what the user clearly intends.  Explicitly typeing DF forms into the BREAK window is much slower and doesn''t cover the cases of looking at the tails of CONDs etc.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date:  6-Sep-84 10':12':40</pre>
