Fixed a long time ago, before the Carol release.  There was a bug in the volume allocation map code which caused the free page count to get out of whack from time to time when allocating pages.  At the same time, I created a workaround': call (DISKFREEPAGES volumeName T), and it will recompute the number of free pages.  -- Tayloe.'["stansbury" " 5-Sep-84 18':43':50" Assigned% To': Attn': Disposition':]'["stansbury" " 5-Sep-84 18':44':17" Assigned% To': Attn': Status':(Open-&gt;Fixed) Disposition': Edit-By': Edit-Date':]Description: 'Return-Path': YONKE@USC-ECL.ARPA'Received': from USC-ECL.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 11 MAY 84 10':03':59 PDT'Date': Fri, 11 May 84 10':03':17 PDT'From': Martin Yonke &lt;Yonke@USC-ECL.ARPA&gt;'Subject': strangeness in VOLUMEDISPLAY window'To': LispSupport.PA''After repartitioning the physical volume into 3 lisp parts. and a'BootLisp and then making Lisp3 into DSK and running lisp (MAKESYSDATE ='9-Apr-84 19':08':22) in the partition called Lisp, I started copying files'from a floppy to DSK.  First, the number of pages "allocated" to the'partition I was running in (Lisp) went from 16200 to -1, then later to'-32769, and then back to -1 (where it is right now).  Somewhere in there'I also deleted some files from DSK and did a couple of DIRs on both the'floppy and DSK devices (sorry I don''t remember the exact sequence, but'that is all I was doing -- copying files with some DELFILEs and'DIRECTORYs in the middle).  Sometime after the allocation went to -1 the'second time, the number of "free pages" also went to -1 in the Lisp'partition.  That is currently where it stands.  Mind you this is the'information displayed in the VOLUMEDISPLAY window -- the system is still'running fine as best as I can tell other than that.  If there is a'question I didn''t answer, please call or send a message.'''Good Luck,'Martin''-------''Return-Path': YONKE@USC-ECL.ARPA'Received': from USC-ECL.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 16 MAY 84 11':05':42 PDT'Date': Wed, 16 May 84 11':04':57 PDT'From': Martin Yonke &lt;Yonke@USC-ECL.ARPA&gt;'Subject': strange page counts in DLIONFS'To': LispSupport.PA''my previoous message about the volume display having fun numbers in it'for the volume I was running in as I moved files from floppy to DSK said'that everything seemed to be fine.
