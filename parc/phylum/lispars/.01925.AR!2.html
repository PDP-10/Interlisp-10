DOE MACSYMA runs on the DEC VAX-series of computers under the VMS operating system, and'corresponds quite closely with the 1982 version of MIT-MC MACSYMA'(the translator/compiler interface work, but advanced plotting'features need work.) Those not already a member of NESC should'contact':''National Energy Software Center'Argonne National Laboratory'9700 South Cass Avenue'Argonne, Illinois 60439'Attention': Jan Mockler''for information about joining, and should inquire about accession'number 9847.  We are advised that there are two VAX-VMS BACKUP'format tapes with 40 MB of code': source to DOE MACSYMA and NIL,'object modules, executable images, control and auxiliary'information.  This work is supported by DOE Contract W-7405-ENG-48.''Users wishing to contribute programs and codes to the New MACSYMA'Users Consortium, for re-distribution through NESC, may send their'material to Leo Harten, Paradigm Associates, Inc., 29 Putnam'Avenue, Suite 6, Cambridge, MA 02139, or to'Harten@Mit-Multics (Multics mail is no longer case-sensitive).'[This is a volunteer effort for the improvement of the SHARE'libraries in DOE MACSYMA.]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 17':58':09</pre>
