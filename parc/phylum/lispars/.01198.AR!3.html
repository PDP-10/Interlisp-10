(21 msg), while I only retrieved 8.  Earlier in the morning I had read mail on ERNESTINE and deleted a number of messages.  It seems possible that the 21 is the sum of messages retrieved by Lafite and messages deleted by me on Ernestine.  If so, it seems as if the place you get the number of messages which you display in the promptwindow from didn''t take notice of the fact that you delete messages on Lily/Ernestine.''		Kris''-----'Date': 24 May 84 15':40 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''Indeed, the number that Lafite prints is actually the total number of messages, deleted or not.  Of course, only the undeleted ones are retrieved.  I guess Lafite should at least tell you that there were some deleted messages, so you don''t get confused by the discrepancy.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-May-84 10':52':34</pre>
