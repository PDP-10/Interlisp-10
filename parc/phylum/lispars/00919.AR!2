When trying to install'a 5-disk sysout, e.g., loops, on BOOTLISP, a prompt appears saying'(more) 'after the third disk has been read, but I haven''t figured out what I can say that'will keep the installation going through the other 2 disks. In contrast,'when installing onto LISP volume, it specifically prompts for ANOTHER DISK'after disk 3 is read. BOOTLISP has plenty of room for the LOOPS sysout. It is'9400 blocks and bootlisp is 13000 blocks. Perhaps when time permits, the response'of different volumes to extra disks should be standardized.'--Alan'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  1-Jun-84 12':38':43Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: FixedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
