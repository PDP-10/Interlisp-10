The tablet connects to your D0 via the printer port.  The program gives you easy access to all of the tablet''s many features and operating modes, and includes a simple Draw-type program that lets you use the tablet to paint on the screen.''Use':  You need &lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt;RS232.DCOM.  Then load &lt;Lispusers&gt;MM1201.DCOM and call (MM1201).  This will bring up the main menu.  Documentation is on &lt;Lispusers&gt;MM1201.TED.  Comments, questions, etc. to me as usual.''Aside': KAL (Kaleidoscope), CALENDAR, and PACMAN have all been significantly revised/improved since their first announcements.  Enjoy!''			- Michel'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: FixedProblem Type: Source Files: </pre>
