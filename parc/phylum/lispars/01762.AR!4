Since the mouse was dead,  I tried to recover by typing STOP.  First each of the icons expanded one by one into full-sized windows.  Then a series of window zombies began appearing':  One by one windows I had had in the distant past began popping up meanwhile cycling through a confusing selection of current and past windows being on top.  Pretty soon it became difficult to tell which were the real windows and which were the ghosts of the past.  All this time it wouldn''t accept input from the keyboard.  Finally I managed to hit it with a nearby control-E.  Then I set about trying to shoot CLOSEs into some of the Zombies, but new windows kept appearing.  I SHRANK some of my good windows, but a few turned into books without titles.''Did I hit a feature or a bug?''-----''Sender': Sannella.PA'Date':  7 Aug 84 15':19':15 PDT (Tuesday)'Subject': Re': Lisp': Attack by the Window Zombies'In-reply-to': card''s message of 6 Aug 84 15':59 PDT'To': card'cc': LispSupport'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''It is a feature that control-C throws you into Raid.  As you know, STOP recovers from that.  It is a feature that the Tedit windows redisplay themselves after a hard reset, which is what STOP does.  Both of these "features" are annoying, and will get fixed eventually.''It is not a feature that you get "window zombies".  This is a bug, which I will report as sush.''-----''Date':  7 Aug 84 20':27 PDT'From': acuff.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Attack by the Window Zombies'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 7 Aug 84 15':19':15 PDT (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': acuff.pa''   Perhaps the doc should push UNDO ^N as the proper "recovery procedure" from an accidental ^C on a DLion, assuming it *might* be around for a while yet.''	-- Rich''-----'Subject': AR 1762 Lisp': Attack by the Window Zombies'To': Card'cc': LispSupport''I could not duplicate the "attack of the window zombies".  I did get a lot of tedit windows opened from tedit processes that I thought I had killed (closing them didn''t stop the tedit process).  But nothing that wasn''t a legal window.  Can you give anymore details?  Were you doing anything unusual?  Can you duplicate it??'''richard''---------'Date': 18 Aug 84 14':58 PDT'From': card.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1762 Lisp': Attack by the Window Zombies'In-reply-to': Burton.pa''s message of 17 Aug 84 18':07 PDT'To': Burton.pa'cc': Card.pa, LispSupport.pa''In the crashes of the last few days of a similar type the phenonenon has not occurred (in newer Lisps) whereas it happened reliably before from which I conclude that the problem went away in newer releases.''--stu'RRB- CHANGED STATUS TO FIXED'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Burton.paEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 08':59':00
