Number: 1842Date: 15-Aug-84 14':02':21Submitter: Sannella.PASource: vanMelle.paSubject: new, simplified PROMPTFORWORDLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 26 Jul 84 12':41 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': more PROMPTFORWORD'To': LispCore&uarr;''Well, here''s the latest in the PROMPTFORWORD saga':''There is no special PROMPTFORWORD cursor.''PROMPTFORWORD no longer grabs the tty.  It behaves exactly like READ etc in this regard (if not the tty, waits for you to click in its window; if under the mouse, grabs tty and spawns mouse).''The old argument Timelimit.secs has been replaced with an argument URGENCY.OPTION, which can be a number of seconds to wait for a response (as before), or T, meaning wait forever, but periodically flash the window to alert the user if a response is not forthcoming.''Currently the only caller with URGENCY.OPTION = T is the password code, but other callers of PROMPTFORWORD might want to consider whether they want the option.  The default is to quietly wait for input, as READ does.''The 9th and final argument OLDSTRING has been flushed.''&uarr;W does what you''d expect it to, rather than being a synonym of &uarr;Q (actually, in the latest loadup, &uarr;W appears to have a bug, which I have fixed for next loadup).''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: FixedProblem Type: Source Files: </pre>
