I want my program''s window to fit in that size.  I don''t want assiciated windows to extend outside that region.''What''s worse is that once the system (whatever it is) starts up ant attaches whatever windows it desires, RESHAPE now has different semantics.  Instyead of just referring to the main window it refers to the whole collection.''I guess I am asking for some way of describing the window layout and a function that will dissect a region into the appropriate subregions.   Right now I have a seperate procedure for each case, and although it works, it''s ugly.  And when you don''t go to such hair your program acts funny.''-----''Date': 12 Sep 84 09':46 PDT'From': DMRussell.pa'Subject': Lisp': GETREGION should also account for attached window sizes'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': DMRussell.pa''Lisp System Date':  8-Sep-84 01':22':25'Machine': Dorado (Russell)'Microcode version': 24,2'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': Always'Impact': Annoying''When I use GETREGION to declare an area of the screen for a set-of-attached-windows (such as when I create a file browser), the region I determine isn''t the region of the screen that actually gets used.
