When the bad address was discovered, Lafite ungreyed its window and popped it back up, and ALSO MADE IT BE THE TTY STREAM.  Thus, all the typing that I was doing into message (2) flipped into the Subject line of message (1), which really seems foolish.''I suggest that a bad message be brought back with extra attention called to it perhaps by flashing it a couple of times, but that it not automatically be made the TTY process.''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 12':41 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': When bad mail comes back [Ar 524]'In-reply-to': Kaplan.pa''s message of 5 Apr 84 09':16 PST'To': Kaplan.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa''Now fixed to not grab the tty.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Apr-84 12':20':34Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: FixedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
