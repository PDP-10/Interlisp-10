It seems that MAKEFILE does not update the FILEDATES property of the atom that is just the file *name* without the extension (which is what FL is.)'	You have no problems if your files are named FOO.;* but if you use files called FOO.BAR;* this bug affects you.  I am surprized that it hasn''t been discovered before.''							Jeff''P.S. My thanks to Thu Le who finally sent out the sources to me.'-------Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
