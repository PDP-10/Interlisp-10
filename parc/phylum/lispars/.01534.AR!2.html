Usually it is possible to detect that this has happened. What is needed is some way to get back in sync by rebuilding the display from the structure.''Rumor has it that there is a set of cached lines between those two as well. I believe the cache gets out of sync with the structure too. As I understand it at the moment, the window REPAINT command builds the display from the cached lines, which doesn''t help. The solution I have used is to scroll the questionable section off the window and back on. Sometimes this works, but not always.''Suggestion': Make the window REPAINT command flush the cache, clear the window, and rebuild both from the underlying structure.''Austin'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':46':22</pre>
