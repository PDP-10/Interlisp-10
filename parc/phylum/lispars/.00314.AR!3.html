I''ll edit the LISTFILES in DMISC to cooperate more with the new SINGLEFILEINDEX (i.e., dont do the removal -- let SINGLEFILEINDEX process be the only one to do it), but this isn''t a real high priority bug.  There should be an AR for this bug, however.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 17':44':44</pre>
