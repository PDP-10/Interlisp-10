Put the file away.  Quit from tedit.  Do a DIR with file name and give it a default TYPE.  File return with Type  BINARY' Tedit always writes files of type binary.  Files of type text are needed when all you want to do is edit a text file and have it read by Lisp or a program running on a VAX or DEC20, etc.  There should be some way of getting text files.  Teknowledge uses TEDIT to edit a knowledge base which is shared by different computers, all of which anticipate text files.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 18-Jun-84 15':30':35</pre>
