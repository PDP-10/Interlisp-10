I cannot repeat this, but what I was usually doing was trying to make small bold caps by first bolding the entire line, then selecting from the second character to the end and making the font one point smaller.  It happened again when I changed a line of bold Helvetica 12 (first character) and Bold helvetica 11 (rest of characters) to Bold Helvetica 12 (first character) and regular Helvetica 12 (rest of characters).  I will edit the AR if the bug is not found and I figure out how to repeat it.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  6-Jun-84 14':54':08Attn: sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Century315Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: IFSServer Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: MinorPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
