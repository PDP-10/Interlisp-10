The  main complaint that I had was that the Dedit menu (like all other menus) positions itself under the mouse such that the most-recently-used field is directly under the mouse.  This has some advantages, but in the case of an editor, I believe it  makes the development of memorized command sequences more difficult, because the user must always look at the menu and see where the mouse is before beginning the key-click sequence.''I was talking to Paul Rosenbloom at HPP, and he suggested that one possible solution would be to make Dedit always come up with the mouse in the same position (say, at the middle of the menu) over a special item.  This item would change after every command to be the same as the item most recently used.  This combines the advantages of the current scheme with the advantages of a "stationary" menu.''If someone can point me to the right files, I''d be willing to prototype this idea myself and see how well it works.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
