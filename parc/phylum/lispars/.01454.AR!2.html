According to the manual, upon not finding the file CLASSIC8BI.STRIKE, it would find eventually CLASSIC8.STRIKE and fake the rest by double striking and slanting the bitmap.  It was presumably doing that when I got a break window with the message "256 - ILLEGAL ARG."  I checked the function that was doing this and it was ELT, with arguments A = {ARRAYP}#X,XXXXX and N = 256.  Sure enough, (ARRAYSIZE A) returned 252.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 18-Jun-84 12':48':06Attn: Kaplan,Nuyens.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: FontsMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
