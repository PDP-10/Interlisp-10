Not seeing a builtin Hardcopy command, I bugged middle in the title to get Tedit''s menu, from which I selected Hardcopy.  This quickly broke with an ILLEGAL ARG {STREAM}xxx in (DSPXPOSITION NIL {STREAM}xxx) in MB.DISPLAY in \TEDIT.PRESS.DISPLAYLINE.  {STREAM}xxx was {CORE}TEDIT.PRESS;1, which, of course, does not support DSPXPOSITION.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 17':27':55
