Example -- '''This is the current structure':''        -BoxedFn1'       /'TopFn----BoxedFn2'       \'        -UnboxedFn3--BoxedFn2--BoxedFn1--UnboxedFn4--BoxedFn2'''This is what I''d rather see''        -BoxedFn1--UnboxedFn4--BoxedFn2'       /'TopFn----BoxedFn2--BoxedFn1'       \'        -UnboxedFn3--BoxedFn2'''The latter format gives preference to the topmost&amp;leftmost "boxed" instance of a function node as being the primary node for that funciton; the other "boxed" nodes with the same label can then be viewed as "continuation" pointers.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: LibraryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
