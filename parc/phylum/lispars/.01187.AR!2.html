When I came back, hours later, it was trying to draw lines WAY off the screen and getting into serious trouble. I don''t know why this was happening, but I have some suspicion that it is arithmetic microcode. I will try it again.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.paEdit-Date: 26-Aug-84 16':04':05</pre>
