Is it feasible for you to add "Source Files" to the set of things listed in my summary, and sort by System/Subsystem/SourceFiles/etc.?  I imagine very few ar''s have a non-null Source Files field, so this would tend to be a noop for those not using it.  But I would be happy to use this field, pretending it means "logical module".  Also, it would make it easier to spot new ar''s (they would bubble to the top of their subsystems by virtue of having a blank Source Files).''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 28-Jun-84 15':29':49Attn: SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
