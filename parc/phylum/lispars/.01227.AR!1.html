In these cases, PF could be returning lists like "(FN not found in FULLFILENAME)" and "(FILE not found)" or perhaps just give a standard "FILE NOT FOUND" break for case (2) and leave case (1) to return NIL.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 24-May-84 15':47':38Attn: KaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: 5121Memory Size: 2688File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
