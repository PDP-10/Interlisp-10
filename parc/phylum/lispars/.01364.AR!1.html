This is very annoying.  The menu should track smoothly or not at all.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  5-Jun-84 16':23':13Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
