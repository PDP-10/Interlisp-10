This is what has changed':''The Rename command now takes a default destination directory when called with multiple files.  (AR 321)''The Copy command now works when you''re only copying a single file.  (No AR (!) for this one)''The See command pops up a scrollable window containing the listing of the file.  (The old version''s window didn''t scroll). (No AR)''The FileBrowser has its own prompt window, and no longer pops up superfluous windows.  (AR 322)''Prompts no longer have missing punctuation. (AR 323)''It puts up an "Expunge deleted files" menu when you try to shrink or close the window and there are unexpunged deleted files.  (AR 760)''It shrinks to a distinctive icon. (AR 760)''It uses a "nicer" font  for the list of files. (No AR)''Remaining problems':''The same operations that were slow continue to be so, pending work on the Interlisp-D directory code. (AR 113)''It still treats subdirectories strangely (ARs 324, 489, 343)'''~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'I''d like to hear what you think of it.  Send your comments to Jellinek.pa.
