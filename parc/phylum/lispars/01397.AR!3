The easiest way I know of to get \GC.BIGREFCNT.MISSING is to DelRef something whose refcnt is zero (this a case that microcode might profitably punt on, so that Lisp code could trap it) and then do any other refcnt op on it.  But, of course, that just begs the question of why anyone was doing THAT.  Sounds like random smashing to me.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 21-Jun-84 12':37':20
