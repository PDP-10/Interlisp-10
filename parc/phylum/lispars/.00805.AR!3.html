This even works with PUP FTP.  It one STOREs'a file to CDP0': at SUMEX, for example, it gets spooled for printing'on our IMprint-10.  '	Unfortunately, in Interlisp-D, UNPACKFILENAME parses the'device and host just fine for {SUMEX}CDP0': , but then'\FTP.UNPACKFILENAME ignores the device and supplies the bogus name of'NIL.  Could you fix \FTP.UNPACKFILENAME to pass the device through?'The bogus name of NIL doesn''t hurt, incidentally.
