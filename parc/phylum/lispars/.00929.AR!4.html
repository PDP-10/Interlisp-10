''Login appends a registry only if DEFAULTREGISTRY is non-NIL. (This is a feature only of use to internal Xerox users.) ''The value of DEFAULTREGISTRY should be NIL in the standard sysout. ''There were some versions of our local init file distributed as ''examples'' of what a site-dependent initialization file might look like. In that file, we set DEFAULTREGISTRY to PA.
