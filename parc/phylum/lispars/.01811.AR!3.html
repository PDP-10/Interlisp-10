I had the file COMS for the file in a DEdit window.  The window didn''t get "dimmed", and when I did a DC on the file just afterwards, it didn''t get updated, even when I selected around the changed item, although doing "Reprint" caused correct information to be displayed.''	-- Rich''-----''Date': 13 Aug 84 17':21 PDT'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': AR 1811': DEdit doesn''t notice COMS changed by RENAME'To': Acuff'cc': LispSupport, masinter''DEdit doesn''t notice changes to a file''s COMS after a RENAME of an object on that file b/c the RENAME doesn''t call MARKASCHANGED on the COMS when it edits it to tell the world that the COMS have been changed (I guess it figures that the file will already be dumped because of the change to the structure RENAMEd, so why do it twice).''If noone says anything when a change like this is made, it''s kinda hard for DEdit to notice. Thus, existing DEdit windows will be wrong until you touch the offending structure.''In the past, there has been disagreement as to whether the semantics of MARKASCHANGED require it to be called whenever anything is changed so systems like DEdit can notice. I can see it both ways. However, if this is a bug, it is a bug in RENAME, not DEdit.''Beau''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':19':46Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
