''I notice that there are some other I.S.OPRS properties with CLISP forms in them, but they are required; e.g., (X lt Y) in one place can''t be pre-dwimified because there may be local declarations that cause "lt" to go to FLESSP rather than ILESSP.''-- JonL --''''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':04':36</pre>
