All one has to do is to type in three words causing a few line overflows and the screen turns into unintelligible spaghetti.   I think this is largely because TEdit does not correctly understand how to handle baseline, ascents and descents during updating the screen.  Basically, it ignores one or more of these factors in almost everyone of the screen updating routines.''This situation is VERY, VERY bad for those of use trying to build production systems on TEdit.  I have built my own version of TEdit with a global variable called TEDIT.DOSLOWUPDATES.  If this variable is non-NIL, TEDIT bombs out of the "clever" screen updating routines into TEDIT.UPDATE.SCREEN.  I basically put this escape in at every point that TEdit does the corresponding escape for the LHASTABS business.''The impact setting TEDIT.DOSLOWUPDATES seems to have littl effect on the speed of TEdit, though it does make the screen updating appear jerky (A small proce to pay considering the alternative is to smoothly achieve nonsense of the screen).''I would like to suggest that the official TEdit version include this escape mechanism.  That way the user could choose between fast, buggy screen updates and somewhat slower, but correct screen updates.'''Frank''-----''Date': 24 Aug 84 10':19 PDT'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': TEdit': Need TEDIT.DOSLOWUPDATES globalvar to make up for multitude of bugs in screen updating 'In-reply-to': Halasz.pa''s message of 21 Jun 84 18':55 PDT'To': Halasz.pa'cc': TEditSupport.pa''Try the SLOWUPDATE TEXTPROP instead''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 10':55':34
