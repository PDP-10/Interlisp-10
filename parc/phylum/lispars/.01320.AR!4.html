On the 6th of May, I added code in the RS232 file to correct for this condition (power-cycled off/on), and to re-initialize the Martin board when possible.   ''Since that is the only modification between the Apr 26 version (which appears to be what made it into the Fugue.6 release) and the current one on [Phylum]&lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt; dated the 7-May-84, I think you could safely and profitably distribute that with Carol.''I''m a bit puzzled about the state of RS232CHAT on [RoseBowl]&lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt; -- the source is dated 28-Jan-84, and the .dcom is dated 27-Apr-84.  But the corresponding dates on [Phylum]&lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt; are both 8-May-84, with a backup .dcom at 28-Jan and a backup source at 5-Dec-83; in fact, the 8-May-84 source was edited directly of the  5-Dec-83 source.''Don''t you keep a consistent "snapshot" of the various releases somewhere?  Or is the creationdate on RoseBowl''s directory that of the time at which the FTP from Phylum was done?  One has to remember that the Alto FTP program will retain the creation date of files it transfers, but Lisp''s COPYFILE always sets the new files creation date to be that of the time of copying.''-- JonL --'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 12':01':50Attn: Assigned To: JonL.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: Was fixed in the 7-May-84 version of RS232 file.   Problem was that turning the machine off and on again while "logged out" reset the UART; the re-entry function was modified to alway re-do the initialization.System: CommunicationsSubsystem: RS232Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: FatalPriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
