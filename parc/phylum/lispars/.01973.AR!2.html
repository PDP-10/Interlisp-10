This would be more likely that somehow the tick/to/millisecond timers weren''t getting reset properly, and that the timers etc in the clock were not getting updated properly. Is this reproducable? Maybe we should test explicitly moving a sysout from DLion to Dorado, I don''t think anybody does that here.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 17':05':45</pre>
