This means the next LOAD (with LOADDBFLG = YES) will NOT load'the data base file since it thinks it is old.  What has to be done is'first MAKEFILE file file, reLOAD it and then DUMPDB.''In my project we deal with 25+ source files they take over an hour to'analyze if we cannot save this information with SAVEDBFLG = YES.  I am'surprised that this bug hasn''t been encountered before.''							Jeff''P.S. My project and I consider this a pretty serious bug and I would'like the source to fix myself if this will not be fixed in the near'(i.e. this week) future.
