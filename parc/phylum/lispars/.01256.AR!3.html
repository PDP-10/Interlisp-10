For example, the mouse'would say C-U 4 C-F and the cursor would just stay still.  If you'refresh the screen with a &uarr;L you *will* find the cursor in the correct'place.  If you type the command by hand it works!  We have determined'that EMACS *is* seeing the commands (via &uarr;&larr;L) but is *not* sending'cursor positioning back to the NVT (running EMACS under PHOTO.)  It'*did* work about two weeks ago just fine but is not working now.  Does'anyone have any possible explaination?''						Jeff'P.S.  The particulars are':'	The CHAT program emulates a DM2500'	We are using EMACS version 162 on a DEC-20'Workaround: 'Date': 26 May 84 13':37 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'To': SHULMAN@RUTGERS''(ADVISE ''CHAT.EMACS.MOVE ''AFTER'	''(BSPFORCEOUTPUT (WINDOWPROP WINDOW ''SOCKET)))'Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 10':20':40</pre>
