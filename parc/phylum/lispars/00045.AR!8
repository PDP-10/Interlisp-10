''For most of that time I was using the Carol full.sysout ( I can''t recall the date) made just before this one.  Then, typing ^D or ^C or ^B or ^E did nothing but print "^D" (or "^C" etc.).  Once in a while ^C worked but I usually ended up booting out of Lisp.''I have been using this latest version (also a full.sysout) for a few days now.  The only control key which does not respond is ^D.'''Stephanie'-----'Date': 13 Mar 84 15':24 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 45': ^D disabled'In-reply-to': lispar.Auto''s message of 13 Mar 84 11':34':07 PST (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa''This is probably still the tedit bug that Tedit smashes the user''s interrupts with TEDIT.INTERRUPTS.'-----'Date': 14 Mar 84 21':42 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': TEdit': ^D getting disabled'To': TEditSupport'cc': Kaplan.pa'TEdit-System-Date':  2-Mar-84 16':54':27'Lisp-System-Date': 13-Mar-84 10':21':31'Machine-Type': Dorado''I have a simple function that sets up a Tedit process on a window, and then moves the TTY.PROCESS back to what it was before.''Whenever I run this function, I end up with ^D being disabled.

If the TTY was taken away from TEdit before it had set up the interrupts, the disabling was happening in the new TTY process.
