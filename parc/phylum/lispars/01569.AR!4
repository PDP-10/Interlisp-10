Looking at LOGINPASSWORDS shows first of all as many entries  for dir as the LOGIN was executed instead of just one, and secondly, that the encrypted password  is a string of length 3, whereas the password contains 4 characters.'The effect is that I can''t COPYFILE or SYSOUT to that directory. I''m quite sure it has something to do with the passwording, since the COPYFILE prompts for connect password also with the message "incorrect connect password" (even though I do it explicitly beforehand) and then aborts. If I do the COPYFILE to my own directory, then enter chat and connect to dir giving same password, I can move the file to dir allright.''-- Hans''-----''Date': 29 Jun 84 11':48 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1569': (LOGIN host NIL dir) mangle password'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 29 Jun 84 10':48':01 PDT (Friday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa''LOGIN does not mangle the password, even if it looks that way and the reported bug with COPYFILE/SYSOUT has nothing to do with LOGIN.  It is, rather, a long ago reported bug in the PupFtp implementation, fixed in Harmony.  I forget the AR number, since I fixed it quite a while ago.''However, there are still bugs': The bug in LOGIN relating to connect password entries being duplicated is still there (minor), and there is still a bug in PupFtp wherein you get asked the connect password every time (but at least it succeeds).''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':17':14Attn: Assigned To: vanMelleIn/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
