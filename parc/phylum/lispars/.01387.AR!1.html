Number: 1387Date: 11-Jun-84 13':40':53Submitter: vanMelleSource: vanMelleSubject: Display button should not usurp the mouse if delayedLisp Version:  8-Jun-84 14':13':12Description: 'The Display button runs under the mouse, rather than as a separate process.  Fine if the mail file is on {DSK}, or the entire message is already buffered and available but if it is remote, you potentially tie up the mouse too long.  Similar problem with Delete if it implies Display next.'-------'Date':  4 Jun 84 09':57 PDT'From': Feuerman.pasa'Subject': Lafite': Mouse Control''When "Display"ing a long message in Lafite from a mail file on the file server, sometimes the file server has problems, goes down, times out, or what have you.  At any rate, the Leaf Abort Window can come up during the Display function.  The problem here is that the MOUSE process is still tied up with the Display function, so unless one knows to type (SPAWN.MOUSE) at the TTY, they can''t click ABORT in the Leaf Abort Window.  Can a new MOUSE process be spawned automatically during the Display function, without causing problems for multiple Lafite commands (such as Displaying and Deleting the same message at the same time)?''------'Date':  8 Jun 84 21':22 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''Yes, this is a real problem.  Not only when servers go down, but even just when they''re slow and you have a long message to display and would like to do something else with your mouse while you''re waiting.  The competing consideration is that you don''t want to slow down Display any more than it is already, so it would be nice if there were some easy way to tell whether spawning a mouse would be desirable.  I''ll add this to the list of interface problems to think about.''You can, by the way, safely spawn a mouse (either by typing (SPAWN.MOUSE) or clicking "Spawn Mouse" in the menu you get by typing the help interrupt) and not screw up trying to run other Lafite commands at the same time.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 11-Jun-84 13':40':53Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
