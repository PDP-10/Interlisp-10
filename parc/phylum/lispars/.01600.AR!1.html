Could it be redone to be stream/window relative?   Or just give it another argument so that  (RADIX n) still changes global (default?) radix, but (RADIX n stream) changes stream''s radix.  .... or something like that.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 10-Jul-84 13':56':17Attn: Burton, KaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
