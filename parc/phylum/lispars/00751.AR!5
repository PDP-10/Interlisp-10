'...'-----''Date': 18 Apr 84 12':49 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'...' The problem is that GETRAISE does not test the validity of its TTBL arg before going uninterruptable.  Aside from that, the definition of this function is fairly gross--it does a (INTERRUPTABLE (PROG1 (INTERRUPTABLE) --)), the Interlisp-10 version of UNINTERRUPTABLY.  Larry or Ron': surely we can do better than this.  First and foremost, GETRAISE ought to be defined at the appropriate level, instead of this kludge from HPRINT.  Secondarily, how about giving UNINTERRUPTABLY a suitable 10MACRO so it can be used in shared code?Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 18':49':21
