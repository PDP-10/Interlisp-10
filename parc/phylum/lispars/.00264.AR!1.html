And perhaps middle button could be used to say "resume printing and don''t stop again" --- this might also clear up some of the problems with typeahead being send to the wrong place when possesion of the tty is moving around under program control.''---Jim 'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
