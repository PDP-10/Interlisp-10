Number: 1575Date: 29-Jun-84 12':57':19Submitter: KaplanSource: KaplanSubject: Floppy error sequence when attempting to write a write-protected floppyAssigned To: Attn: Status: ClosedIn/By: HarmonyProblem Type: Design - ImplImpact: AnnoyingDifficulty: Frequency: EverytimePriority: HopefullySystem: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion FloppyMachine: 1132Disk: Lisp Version: 28-Jun-84 12':58':33Source Files: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: [DATE 23-JUL-84 ROACH Floppy now prints "Floppy': Write protected" in stream T before generating an error.  If the error was during OPENFILE, the system error (which comes in addition to the write protected message) will be "FILE WON''T OPEN".  If not during an OPENFILE (e.g., during a format or scavenge), the system error will be "HARD DISK ERROR".  There are only 52 system errors available, and "HARD DISK ERROR" is the closest.]'["Sannella.PA" "21-Aug-84 15':48':42" Attn': Status':(Fixed-&gt;Closed) In/By': System':(Programming% Environment-&gt;Operating% System) Subsystem':(Other-&gt;DLion% Floppy)]Description: When you try to write on a floppy that is write-protected, the system puts a message to that effect in the Promptwindow, and then causes a break with the uninformative message HARD DISK ERROR.  If the user hasn''t noticed the line or two in the prompt, he''s apt to think that the floppy is damaged in some way.''Seems to me that the error generated should be more along the lines of file protection error, or an explicit FLOPPY IS WRITE-PROTECTED error, and that nothing should be put in the prompt window.''--RonWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 15':48':42</pre>
