Just as the copying starts, how about printing a message saying how many floppies will be required, so the user has some notion of what''s in store for him.''2.  Instead of saying INSERT NEXT FLOPPY between floppies, how about saying INSERT FLOPPY #n, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...  This would both give the user some sense of his progress, and also make it clear to him that a new floppy transition is taking place.  The way it is now, looking at the screen, the user doesn''t obviously know whether it is a new INSERT message, or just the old one still being displayed.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: RoachEdit-Date: 26-Aug-84 12':22':26</pre>
