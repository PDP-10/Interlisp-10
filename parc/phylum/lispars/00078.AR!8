The latter still doesn''t work,  whereas the former does.  My text just runs off the edge of the page after the first 1-3 lines depending on how short the first few lines are.  DSPXPOSITION seems to be acting as a NOOP.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':26':59
