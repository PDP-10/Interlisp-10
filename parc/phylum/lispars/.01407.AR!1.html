Furthermore, if you backspace on that line, it wipes out part of the image from the line above.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 13-Jun-84 13':48':02Attn: SybalskyAssigned To: SybalskyIn/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
