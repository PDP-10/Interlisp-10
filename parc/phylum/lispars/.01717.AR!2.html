Spelling correction at the beginning of the loadup should have the ''typical'' things that people type in, like LOAD, MAKEFILE, CLEANUP, etc. on the spelling list.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date: 15-Aug-84  0':26':31Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: DWIMMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 3071File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
