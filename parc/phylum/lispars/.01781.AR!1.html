''Since two different process which want to access the same file will actually share one i/o stream over that file, then compiling and listing of the file at the same time won''t actually work -- one process will, for example, close the file before the other one is finished with it.  Somewhere on the development queue is the plan to introduce multiple streams into Interlisp, but for now one must simply be aware of the gap.''This means that if you want the LIST option to be part of CLEANUPOPTIONS, you must have it after at the end of the list; e.g.'    (RC ST LIST)'rather than '    (LIST RC ST)''-- JonL --'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: jonl, SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
