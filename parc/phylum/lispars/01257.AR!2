I remained unlogged-in.  Only relevant clue was that INDIGO should have been very busy at the moment I tried CHATting.''------'Date': 26 May 84 13':58 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Chat fails at Login'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 24 Apr 84 20':29 PST'To': JonL.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa, LispSupport.pa''I have noticed very intermittently a problem chatting to IFS''s wherein they act as if they are in a pagehold after printing the herald line.  They then gobble up the "L" to release the hold, after which "ogin" doesn''t work too well.  Do you recall if the window complemented at the time?''	Bill''-----''Date': 26 May 84 15':59 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Chat fails at Login'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 26 May 84 13':58 PDT'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': JonL.pa, LispSupport.pa''I sent some message to you, oh maybe a month ago, with essentially these symptoms reported.  I don''t generally remember seeing the chat window inverted in these circumstances; but once in a long while I do get an inversion, at "odd" times, that takes an incredibly long time to revert back.''-- JonL --'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  5-Jun-84 13':36':19Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: PUP ProtocolsMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: IntermittentImpact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
