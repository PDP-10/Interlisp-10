When I interrupt my typing to the EXEC window with a &uarr;B'I get a break window just as I should.  But I cannot position the'caret with the mouse in this break window.  I am unable to backspace'to a preceding line in a multiple line input in the break window.  If'I do a &uarr;B in the break window, instead of recursion I get "Break'within a break on \SAVEVMBACKGROUND&lt;cr&gt;\SAVEVMBACKGROUND&lt;cr&gt;'unbroken.help!&lt;cr&gt;&lt;cr&gt;(HELP broken)", a "HELP': NIL NIL  break':1"'window, etc.''-----''Date':  4 Apr 84 19':34 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'91': The first half of this should have been TTYIN, attn to me; it is now fixed.
