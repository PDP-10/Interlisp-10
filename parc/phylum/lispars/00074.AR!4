If I''m in the business of creating readtables for 'non-lisp work, I''m forced to copy a readtable, smash it to blankness,'then set it to what I want.  Suppose the only way to create a bitmap'was to copy a bitmap etc.  I''d like a function CREATEREADTABLE that'returns a completely blank readtable.  This would also allow'COPYREADTABLE to be implemented using CREATEREADTABLE and function'RESETREADTABLE.  CREATETERMTABLE is missing too.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: roach.PAEdit-Date:  4-Apr-84  9':59':50Attn: Kaplan.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Read and PrintMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: ATBL
