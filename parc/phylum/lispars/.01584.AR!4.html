The property list FONT item seems to be a no-op--unless I''m calling it improperly, in which case the bug is that it doesn''t cause an error.''From what I''ve observed, I''d guess that the default font for Tedit is built-in somewhere.''-----''I discovered that you CAN set the default font, provided that you put the FONT property in the argument to OPENTEXTSTREAM, not in the argument to TEDIT when you are giving Tedit a previously created text stream.  TEDIT doesn''t apply the stream properties to the stream unless it is creating it implicitly, or so it seems.  If this is not a bug, then at least the documentation should be clear about that.''Also, I tried the TEDIT.LOOKS interface for setting the font, also with mixed success.   First, since TEDIT.LOOKS doesn''t simply take a FONT property the way OPENTEXTSTREAM and TEDIT do, I had to build up a complex property list from the font descriptor that I had in hand':''  (LIST ''FAMILY (FONTPROP F ''FAMILY) ''SIZE (FONTPROP F ''SIZE) ....)''Would be much nicer if TEDIT.LOOKS also accepted a FONT property with a font descriptor as value.  (Then the special case of a FONTDESCRIPTOR for the font propery of Tedit (on p 6 of the documentation) could be made less of a distinctive feature.''Indeed, I don''t quite understand why TEDIT and OPENTEXTSTREAM don''t simply take a default LOOKS property, with value just like what can be given to TEDIT.LOOKS.  Then if TEDIT.LOOKS is fixed to take a FONT property, the other cases would fall out (although you might still want to have the special font attribute for convenience).''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':26':52</pre>
