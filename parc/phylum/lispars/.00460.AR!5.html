(7)''-----''Date':  2 Apr 84 19':49 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': AR 460 -- user wants handle on "Top level typescript window"'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa, Le.pasa, JonL.pa''It may be that the luser hasn''t fully grasped the notion of a tty window for each process, but it shouldn''t be a "sin" for several proceses to be dropping printout into the same window -- rather the coordination of such should be the programmer responsibility (with monitor locks, or strategy, or "nothing" if that''s ok).  I know the LOOPS people do something like this -- they have a notion of a global exec window which several processes may be printing into.''PROCESS.TTY is more related to the combination of window/keyboard that makes up a "terminal" -- I think the user is just asking how to get a pointer the the apparently-hidden global resource titled "Top level typescript window" -- but it certainly can''t hurt to probe his motives (e.g., does he REALLY want that window, or would a yatw suffice?)''Apart from documenting \TopLevelTtyWidow, is there any way for a user to find a handle on this window?   He could be told, for example, to just (SETQ MYTTYWINDOW (WHICHW)) with the cursor set appropriately.''-----''Date':  3 Apr 84 11':09 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 460 -- user wants handle on "Top level typescript window"'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 2 Apr 84 19':49 PST'To': JonL.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa, LispSupport.pa, Le.pasa''I didn''t say it was a sin, just not obviously what one wants.  Still too much single-process mentality.''I am absolutely opposed to documenting \TopLevelTtyWindow, a variable that probably ought to go away, at least eventually.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':50':24Attn: Assigned To: vanMelle.paIn/By: Disposition: [bv answered': 4/2/84 If you really want to do this (and note that you usually don''t; a random process usually has no control over what is happening in the top level tty, and no way of coordinating with it--do you really want to print there even if you''re in the middle of a compilation?), there is a function PROCESS.TTY that takes a process as arg and gives back its ttydisplaystream.  Thus, (PROCESS.TTY ''EXEC) might be what you want.]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
