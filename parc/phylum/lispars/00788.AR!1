Progs, gos, etc. are none to swift interpreted in our system.''Most other lisps have put more into specialized hand coded interpreters (in microcode or assembler).'...'c) more design on microcoded interpreter beyond EVAL opcode? Can we do EVAL recursive descent without building frames?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Masi,charn,jonl,purcAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
