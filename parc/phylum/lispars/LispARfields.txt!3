Customers will continue to report problems via phone or 1100Support.pasa. Lisp users at Xerox will continue to submit bug reports to LispSupport/1100Support or AR tools in FULL.SYSOUT. Any "urgent" problems should first have an AR, and then a message with AR number in Subject (so that any subsequent discussion can be appended to the AR).All visible changes to Interlisp-D should be reflected in an AR. Submit an AR with Status: Fixed if necessary.Pasadena will handle 1100Support mail, assign AR numbers and send message back to whomever with AR number. (Possibly could submit AR while on phone to give immediate feedback.) Palo Alto will handle LispSupport mail similarly. We will encourage all customers and non-PARC users to send mail to 1100Support.LispSupport.PA will no longer contain LispCore^. A new mailbox, LISPAR.Auto,  has been created and added to LispSupport.The following will be done every day, by someone (rotating assignment):> Retrieve all LispAR.Auto mail, save on {Eris}<LispCore>Internal>Mail>LispSupport.mail.> Enter bug reports into AR system, modify status/disposition fields of old AR's as appropriate.> Forward requests for service, manuals, information, etc. to the appropriate person.> run the AR.UPDATE program daily to update database, weekly to create new printed summaries.LispCore^ members are expected to respond to all ARs: review categories and modify or reassign; and for high priority tasks, either reject them, alter their priority, or fix the problem. Identify "workaround" by AR number.Until Pasadena classification is more stable, we will also, every day, review the classification of bug reports by 1100Support staff, sending them feedback on classification. Design discussions to LispCore^, not LispSupport.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Design of lisp based AR tools:Field names are in Bold.
