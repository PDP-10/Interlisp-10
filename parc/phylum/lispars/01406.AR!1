Until a button some button is pressed and released, (MOUSESTATE UP) returns NIL when it should return T  (after all all of the buttons are up).  Ths is not a problem with (MOUSESTATE X) since (GETMOUSESTATE) followed by LASTMOUSEBUTTONS returns 7 indicating that all buttons are thought to be down.  This problem does not occur on Dorados and Dolphins and occurs on all 3 DLions I''ve tried it on.''This incorrect sensing can cause problems if you have a BACKGROUNDBUTTONEVENTFN in your sysout.
