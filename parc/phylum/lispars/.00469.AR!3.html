I tried to use DATETIME and was unable to make it do anything useful.  In particular, a call to PARSEDATETIME, eg. (PARSEDATETIME "11 PM") results in an EOF error.''It seems that the eof character they are appending to the string (the vertical bar) is not recognized as such.  The READ in EXPANDINPUT then runs off the end.  I tried using a different character (a $) and it worked (I made $ a breakchr in DTRDTBL).  Unfortunately, the $ caused other problems later on.  The source doesn''t seem to have been changed since 1978.  Has anyone used it lately besides me?''			- Michel'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 17':59':07</pre>
