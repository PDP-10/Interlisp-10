Apparently others have requested a swapped pointer field in the past (Bill did some months before the AR system).  Some of these Mesa communications pointers ** do not ** lie on an even word boundary, so no check should automatically be supplied.''-----''Date':  4 Jun 84 17':11 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': swapped (X)POINTER fields'To': vanMelle,Stansbury'cc': LispCore^''I''ve just submitted an AR on the need for such a field type in the RECORD package.  I''m prodded by the need for a couple of communication cells to the IOP, which use the Mesa pointer format, but I''ve heard that there are other sources for this need. (Indeed, isn''t SWAPPEDFIXP a standard option now?).''Any comments?''-- JonL --''P.S. A "swapped mumble" field is one in which the sense of hiword/loword is the reverse of what it is in InterLisp-D.  In Interlisp, the "hiword" (the segment number part of the adress) is stored in the lower-address word of the two words needed; in Mesa, the "hiword" is stored in the higher-address word.''''[This hasn''t worked right until quite recently -- although the type SWAPPEDXPOINTER has been admissible for some time, it had been requiring double-word alignment.  -- JonL -- 25-Sep-84]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JonL.paEdit-Date: 25-Sep-84 02':02':54
