There''s no particular reason for it to obey a stack discipline--who you were talking to when you brought up the Lafite msg sender 2 minutes or 2 hours ago has little to do with who you want to talk to when you finish, even if said process is still around.  Same argument holds for who you want to talk to when you quit/shrink a Tedit, or quit a Chat, or whatever.  Giving the tty to the top level exec seems a reasonable default.  And it''s so easy to click in whatever window you really do want to type in...''	Bill''-----''Date': 16 Jul 84 13':41 PDT'From': Acuff.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': returns TTY to top level, like CHAT'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 16 Jul 84 12':35 PDT'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': Acuff.pa, LafiteSupport.pa''   I see what you mean to a degree.  The kind of tty switching that would be had with RESETLST (for instance) wouldn''t be good, but how about having the tty go to the process that had it just before this one (NOTE': not the one that had it when this one started), unless that process is dead, in which case it is reasonable to send it to the EXEC.  I think that pealing off into another context for a brief while and then returning is a common thing to do (well, at least for me...), and this structure would support that paradym.''-- Rich'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 17-Jul-84 12':00':25Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
