It is not in Fugue.6, but it has been in Carol sysouts and lispcore sysouts for the last month without being detected, so Beau declared it a non-showstopper.  However, you should know about it.''The problem':  On a Dlion, type Control-C.  You get MP 9915, as the machine goes into Raid.  Now, press the big red STOP key.  Total Catatonia': MP changes to 1108, but the mouse stops tracking and you have to reload lisp.  Note that this does not happen if you exit raid by going into Teleraid (press UNDO) and do control-D.  Also, people use STOP all the time to get out of random MP codes, so I think that it is only the deadly combination of control-C and STOP that causes this problem.''Steve Purcell''s 30-second diagnosis':  When they last squeezed the DLion microcode, they took out some code for handling the UNDO and STOP keys.  Perhaps that is where the bug was introduced.''-----''Date': 23 Jul 84 18':34':16 PDT (Monday)'From': Charnley.pa'Subject': New DLion uCode'To': Lispcore&uarr;'cc': , Charnley''  A new set of microcode for the dandelion has been spliced into {ERIS}&lt;Lispcore&gt;next&gt;Lisp.sysout   and {ERIS}&lt;Lispcore&gt;next&gt;Full.sysout   and' It has been placed on {ERIS}&lt;lispcore&gt;next&gt;dLispDomino.db;5' '  These files contains both 4K and 12K microcode.'  The non-caching bug has been squashed.  Should only impact performance.'  The 4K sysout should recover from &uarr;C now.' '  Problems to me.'  '  don'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Aug-84 14':41':47Attn: Assigned To: CharnleyIn/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: FixedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
