Later I returned and the window seemd to be just sitting there as if I had never bugged "Deliver".  Unfortunately, I couldn''t remember whether I had moused SendMail with the ''Last Message'' option or not (which is what I intended to do after the successful sending). The only way I could be sure that the mail didn''t get Deliver''d was to inspect my newMail, since happily I was one of the CCee''s.  ''Could the title bar be changed in this situation?  or alternatively, could the mesage be placed in the "scheduled prompter" above the Deliver-SaveForm-Abort action bar?  As usual, the problem with putting the error msg in the PROMPTWINDOW is that the latter is usually occluded, and easily scrolled-up by other actions.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 24-Sep-84 14':36':01
