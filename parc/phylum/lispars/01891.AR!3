If you have no gateways on you network, it won''t do anything over the net (the pup gate listener does talk to'itself, but all messages say nothing).  Unlike earlier releases, net zero simply does not work (formerly, net zero meant directly connected net); it simply will not try sending to 0#host#sock, even when it gets the address from a miscserver (of explicit keyin). Fortunately, we (should) go to 4.2bsd on our vax next week, and the pup code for 4.2 includes a gateway.   I don''t think I can easily make carol talk to 4.1bsd, because the net number gets buried in code (bad structure, but ...), so our 4.2 software will currently talk only to net zero, so even forcing the dolphin Gateway code to run without a 10MB net won''t help. Is there an easy workaround (or global flag), or is Carol limited to fully implemented PUP networks (I''ve had the same problem with Smalltalk)'	Darrel'-------''Date': 25 Aug 84 20':20 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''I changed the subject to "Lisp won''t talk to pup net #0 on isolated net".''I am rather skeptical that the problem is as stated, as we have certainly had examples of Pup network #0 running ok on an isolated net, e.g., at AAAI.  Could somebody find out more information, perhaps pup traces of things claimed not to work?  Start out with demonstration of (PUP.ECHOUSER "0#n#") failing for some host n on the local network.''I am changing ar status to Incomplete in the meanwhile.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-Aug-84 20':23':15
