While running under a mouse process he gets a break  with the error  "Stack Overflow".  Eric believes the overflow is spurious, as there are only about 10 frames on the stack.  He &uarr; out of the break and continues.  Several minutes later his system falls into raid.  When he teleraids , the current stack frame is \Freestackblock which is called  from \Extendstack. The EndOfStack field of \InterfacePage is equal to \LastStackAddr.   The crash is not recoverable.''-----''Date': 13 Sep 84 14':41 PDT'From': masinter.pa'Subject': AR#1927, SPURIOUS STACK OVERFLOW CAUSE FATAL CRASHES'To': Dering.pasa, Schoen@sumex-aim'cc': masinter, vanMelle, LispSupport''Did we exchange mail on this one? There are no additional notes in the AR.''I think the main problem is that stack overflows happen in such a way that the process which gets the stack overflow interrupt isn''t necessarily the one that caused the error. I think what we *can* do is somehow make stack overflow interrupts "harder", i.e., interrupt *all* processes somehow.''It should be that you could HARDRESET ("stop" from MP code or Control-D from TeleRaid/Raid) and get your state back.
