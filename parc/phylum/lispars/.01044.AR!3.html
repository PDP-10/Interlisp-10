Now I didn''t pick the'names of the volumes, the install tool did.

This runs into trouble when a given volume takes up more than one line and you have 6 logical volumes on the disk.  Thus, my DLion disk has 5 volumes, 2 of which have very long names and thus take up more than one line on the Volume Display Window.  Unfortunately the window thus only shows 4 volumes = 6 lines.'''Frank''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: stansburyEdit-Date:  5-Sep-84 18':56':56</pre>
