The lossage, of course, is that the nearest Interpress'printer is a loooong walk, and a floor hop away; whereas the press printer'is "just around the corner".''-----''Date': 31 May 84 17':30 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': AR#456, HARDCOPYW and press vs interpress'To': Nuyens, Stansbury, Hausladen, Kaplan, JonL'cc': LispSupport''I dunno if I sent out a message about this before. I added a while back a PRINTERTYPE argument to HARDCOPYW so you could say what kind of printer you were preparing a file for.''In addition, I''ve now made PRINTFILETYPE try harder to recognize the file type; that is what EMPRESS used to decide what kind of printer to send the file to.

I wonder':'  1) Could the "Hardcopy" command in the "Paint" menu be extended to'     utilize this new argument to HARDCOPYW?  Maybe have the existing'     "Hardcopy" command stay the same, but another "PressHardCopy" '     which would try to "press out" the window (rather than interpress).'  2) What happens if the window can''t be fit into the format described'     by the PRINTERTYPE argument?

I''m reluctant to add to the default user interface a lot of complexity that only we at Xerox need. Maybe it is a local Lispusers package to add the complexity to HARDCOPYW''s menu interface. I''m more willing to add the hooks necessary to implement such a lispusers package gracefully, although I think merely advising HARDCOPYW would do it well enough.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84  9':38':14Attn: Assigned To: NuyensIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: HARDCOPYW now takes a PRINTERTYPE argument where you can supply what kind of printer it is. Also, PRINTFILETYPE now tries harder to find out what kind of file it is; EMPRESS uses PRINTFILETYPE to tell.System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
