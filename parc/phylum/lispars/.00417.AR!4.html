But FILECOMSLST apparently thinks it is because the double-starred comment is a list in the COMS list and coincidentally has the form':'	( A * B)'and so B (i.e. Package) is interpreted as the name for a list of entities of type A (i.e. *).''Have fun with this one!''Chris''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':37':19</pre>
