Now and then, when I am doing perfectly innocent things like opening inspect windows, TEdit windows, and loading files, my DLion simply hangs.  No maintenance panel code, no PicoRaid, TeleRaid or the like... nuthin!  I know that  Lisp is stopped because there is no mouse tracking and no swapping... I don''t know about the IOP.''I can''t tell where this comes from, but I can say that I get 9305s alot when I load TEDITMENU off floppies into a sysout (MAKESYSDATE 26-Jan-84).  I haven''t ever been able to load that without getting 9305s.  Could they be related?''/Mitch.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: purcell, charnleyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
