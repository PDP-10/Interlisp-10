Because (a) to new user it is not obvious to think of NewPattern as a kind of Update (b) would decrease amount of mouse movement for relatively common operation.'2) "Update" suggests updating a file, e.g. a directory.  "Redisplay" would be better -- it''s being on this menu rather than on the window-manager menu perhaps being enough to account for its difference in function.'3) Better yet, handle both these with a menu item like BrowseFiles {} with pattern in the {}, like TEdit''s Put {}..Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JellinekEdit-Date: 13-Sep-84 16':25':39</pre>
