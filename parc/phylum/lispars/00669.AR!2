One part is to write microcode for'COPY.N and STORE.N two-byte opcodes for doing stack relative addressing.'I suggest that in addition to COPY (= COPYN 0) we have COPY1, COPY2, and'then a (hard, slower COPY.N two byte). This design is partly because 'there is a much bigger difference on the Dolphin, but pprobably it will 'also make a difference on DLion. ''Now, what to do with this? Well, there is already built into the 'compiler a large suite of optimizations based around stack relative 'addressing, including duplicate sub-expression elimination, and getting 'rid of extra frames where all args are local, etc. I''d like to turn it back on for Interlisp-D, because I think it will matter quite a bit for some of the benchmarks that I''ve done PRINTCODEs of.''[the next AR after I submit this one is to do that integration and testing]Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  3-May-84 12':41':35Attn: Charn,JonL,vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: WishProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files:
