Now, intending to select from there to somewhere to the right of it in the line, click down on Right somewhere to the right of the caret and slightly below, so that what you get instead is selection thru the next line.  If you now correct by moving the mouse up to the original line, you see that the start of your selection is no longer where the caret was; in fact, the caret has moved to where the cursor now is (or to the beginning of its word if the original selection was with middle), and the selection extends thru the next line.''Actually, with a little experimenting, I see you can replace "right" with "left" (not referring to buttons) and/or interchange "above" and "below" and still demonstrate this losing behavior.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
