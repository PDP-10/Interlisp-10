It will run a standard storage full error when there are about 7 "pages" of atom space left, and will fall into "raid" when there will be no more atoms left.  This limits the total number of atoms to 32766.  -- JonL -- 5/1/84'["Sannella" "20-Aug-84 18':32':35" Status':(Fixed->Closed) In/By':]Description: Should error out.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 18':32':36
