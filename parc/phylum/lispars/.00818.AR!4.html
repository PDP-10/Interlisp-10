An off by one in MOVEDSMAP caused by adding the font height to a line position to get a top of line index. This caused the previous line also to get refreshed, sometimes into an incorrect place. - bas'["sheil" "12-Sep-84 09':27':26" Status':(Open-&gt;Fixed) Disposition': Description':]Description: 'In the expression':''(LAMBDA (A) (PROGN (WAIT.FOR.TTY) (SETEDITMENU CDS)))''Switch the two PROGN clauses. In one direction, one gets SETEDITMENUYCDS (i.e. a Y showing thru the SETEDITMENU).  This is because the WAIT.FOR.TTY is repainted during the SETEDITMENU adjustment, i.e., before it is moved.''-----'''Date': 15 Jul 84 15':36 PDT'From': Dietterich.pa'Subject': Lisp': Dedit incorrectly updates display after Switch command'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Dietterich.pa''Lisp System Date': 12-Jul-84 21':27':39'Machine': Dorado (Galileo)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': Always'Impact': Minor''If you have a list whose elements are ((A B C) (A B C D)) and you select (A B C) first and then (A B C D) and then issue the Switch command, the display shows an extra D outside of the (A B C) list.  In general, any white space in the (A B C) list for which the (A B C D) list contains an element will not be properly erased.  If you have the lists ((A B C) (DE FG HI)) and you select the first element, then  the second, and then issue Switch, the display looks like (AEBFC))I instead of (A B C)).''--TomWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sheilEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 09':27':27</pre>
