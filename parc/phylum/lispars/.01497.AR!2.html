Is it necessary to have a flag like this which the user never sees but can have the effect of not making any editing changes visible, or even allowing tthe user to SETQ a varaible at the top level.  Doing a '(SETQ DFNFLG NIL)'has no effect in this situation since no top level SETQ''s work.  (SETTOPVAL was necessary).'danny ''-----''Date': 26 Jun 84 08':35 PDT'From': Bobrow.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1497': DFNFLG being mysteriously set to ALLPROPS'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 25 Jun 84 16':50':01 PDT (Monday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Bobrow.pa''I believe DFNFLG got clobbered when I was doing a (LOADFNS ...
