It is better than HASH for databases (extensible, mimized file access, etc.) and is well debugged. This project involves translating the system from Mesa and debugging it.''Date': 18 Sep 84 09':02':20 PDT'From': Swinehart.pa'Subject': Re': BTree package'In-reply-to': "Your message of 18 SEP 84 06':44 PDT"'To': MASINTER'Cc': swinehart''[Indigo]<Cedar5.1>Btree>BTree.mesa  describes the interfaces for the basic package.
