This AR says to make this a documented interface, and document the fields of a PILOTBITBLT table, and to allow users (with some warnings and cautions) have access to the full performance that calling PILOTBITBLT directly gives you. The system needs it, and so do a lot of users. Yes it is not safe, but it is extremely useful.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 31-May-84 16':42':47</pre>
