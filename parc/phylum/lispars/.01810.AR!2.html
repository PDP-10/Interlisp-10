The problem is the delay between when the mouse process notices the button down and when the menu handler actually gets control.  I am apprehensive that this fix may generate incorrect menu item selection. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND THE WRONG item being selected from a background menu more than you used to.''Richard''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 13':40':42Attn: Assigned To: In/By: AR 507Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: SupersededProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
