Number: 1869Date: 17-Aug-84  8':03':22Submitter: Le.pasaSource: Bird.pasaSubject: Many MP 9xxx breaks when doing Lafite HardcopyLisp Version: carol&gt;full.sysoutDescription: ''Attempting to hardcopy all of the items in this mail folder causes a panic.  In four tests on two 1108''s we''ve had 9004, 9005, 9304 and 9305.  Also, on three occasions, trying to control/B in teleraid has lead to a complete freeze in state 1108 where even teleraid won''t work.  On the fourth occasion a series of different 9000 series errors occurred on each use of teleraid+control/B or teleraid+control/D or teleraid+control/N but I gave up after about a dozen attempts.''The Laurel mail scavenger can find nothing wrong with the folder.  The problem occurs both with my original folder and with the copy specified below.  The file is 44751 bytes long and contains 19 items.''Just in case it is significant (I doubt it), the way I select all the items to be printed is as follows.  When the browser window opens the last item is already selected.  I use the centre button in the scroll margin to position to the top of the index, then use the right button to select all the items.''Workaround: Test Case: {rose}&lt;lispusers&gt;artestcases&gt;lethal.mailEdit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 14':32':20Attn: SybalskyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: FatalPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
