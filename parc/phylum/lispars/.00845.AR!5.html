I am unaware of any place that the user specifies a terminal width to the Chat program.  The width is specified implicitly by the width of the window and the font used; the width that Chat tells the remote host is limited to 127 by protocol constraints.''	Bill''-------'Date': Mon, 30 Apr 84 13':30 PDT'From': Raim.pasa''The terminal width changes when the Chat window is reshaped.  When the new width is such that more 99 characters  per line, can be displayed, only 99 characters are displayed.''-------'Date':  1 May 84 10':58 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''What kind of host was he chatting to?  And did he mean literally 99?  As I mentioned, Chat will not ask for a width greater than 127, but that''s a good deal more than 99.  One possibility is that the host does not support terminal width &gt; 99.''-------'Date': Tue, 15 May 84 15':00 PDT'From': Raim.pasa''The host is  the redoubtable 0#133# running VMS.''Bill reshaped the Chat window to accommodate &gt; 99 characters.  Only 99 characters were seen.''-------'Date': 16 May 84 16':41 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''I talked to Bill White, who did not experience the problem himself and hasn''t noticed it.  He prefers to drop the AR until such time as they think they really have the problem.  So I''ll mark the AR obsolete until such time as you hear more.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 16-May-84 16':51':40</pre>
