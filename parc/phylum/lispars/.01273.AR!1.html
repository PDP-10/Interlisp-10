I tried Logging in again (e.g., (LOGIN ''SHRAGER)) and killing Lafite and all its processes, but when I start it up again, it thinks it knows what my password is, and there''s no way it''s going to let me have another shot at it.''Perhaps instead of issuing an error, Lafite should prompt for a new password if it gets a badpassword connection error.''------'Date': 30 May 84 15':03 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''(LOGIN) should work fine.  (LOGIN ''SHRAGER) informs the system about how you want to log into the host {SHRAGER}, which is not interesting to Lafite.''I''m inclined to agree it ought to prompt you if the password is bad, although there is some subtlety involved in not being obnoxious about it if you happen to not be interested in being logged in to Lafite.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 30-May-84 15':50':22Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
