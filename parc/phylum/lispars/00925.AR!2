I typed in a lot of stuff into that window.''I then did a HARDRESET, which got rid of the edit process but left the text in place.''I then used the background menu again, and, whoops, all of the stuff I typed in disappeared.''I think the logic associated with TEDIT processes is pretty screwy, and that you should revisit the algorithm. Here''s one way of doing it that looks pretty consistent':''If you GET a document, the document comes in "read only" and no process. There is a menu item, visible at the top of the window, which says "Edit". When you button Edit, you can then edit the document. When in that mode, the document stays editable, no matter what the process world does (it either restarts the process whenever you do a hard reset, or more preferably, it restarts the process whenever you button in it. In fact, it seems unreasonable to have more than one TEDIT process ever! Since more than one can''t be active, why waste all of that (precious) stack space just to have dead processes around who''s only job is to capture keystrokes. ????)'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 22-May-84 10':49':12
