Right now, there''s no way for TEdit to know that someone doesn''t want characters like that--much less which characters are "like that".''	One facet of the IMAGEOBJ proposal was a way for two applications to support inter-application copying.  As I recall, it included having a filter on the incoming end.  None of it, of course, has been implemented; however, the thoughts still exist, as part of &lt;Lispcore&gt;Library&gt;ImageObj.TEdit -- if you''d care to comment on the proposal, I''m sure we can raise its priority (now that we have you as a potential user....)''	--John''-----''Date': 10 May 84 15':03 PDT'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1003': Shift selecting from TEDIT into DEDIT edit buffer gives garbage'In-reply-to': Sybalsky.pa''s message of 10 May 84 14':02 PDT'To': Sybalsky.pa'cc': Nuyens.pa, LispSupport.pa''Are the &uarr;F''s really in the document or are they TEdit control info?''Beau''-----''Date': 10 May 84 15':38 PDT'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1003': Shift selecting from TEDIT into DEDIT edit buffer gives garbage'In-reply-to': Sheil.pa''s message of 10 May 84 15':03 PDT'To': Sheil.pa'cc': Sybalsky.pa, Nuyens.pa, LispSupport.pa''If TEdit un-reads them, they''re REALLY in the document -- it doesn''t try to copy formatting info.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date:  5-Jun-84 10':27':26</pre>
