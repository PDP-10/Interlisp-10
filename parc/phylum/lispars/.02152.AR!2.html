Number: 2152Date: 11-Sep-84 19':54':38Submitter: JonL.paSource: JonL.paSubject: Loading message for out-of-core definitions too brief for EDIT': should mention WHAT is loadedAssigned To: Attn: Masinter,KaplanStatus: OpenIn/By: Problem Type: Design - UIImpact: AnnoyingDifficulty: Frequency: EverytimePriority: PerhapsSystem: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: 1132Disk: Lisp Version:  7-Sep-84 23':54':06Source Files: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 6144File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: '["Sannella.PA" "12-Sep-84 13':08':08" Subject': Status':(New-&gt;Open) Priority':(-&gt;Perhaps)]Description: When doing any of the generalized DEF operations on a FNS definition which currently isn''t "in core", and when that definition can be found (presumably by means of WHEREIS), then it is prop-LOAD''d.  But the message printed out during this phase simply says something like'"loading from file {ERIS}&lt;USER&gt;ALLMY.DATA"'Espeically during calls from the functional interface to the TTY EDITOR, it would be nice if it could say'"loading SOMEFN from file {ERIS}&lt;USER&gt;ALLMY.DATA"'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':08':09</pre>
