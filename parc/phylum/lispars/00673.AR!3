We''ve had some other desires for merging RS232 and Ethernet Chat capabilities; this is yet another capability that should be shared.''With the current RS232 driver, we''re not going to be able to do this-- it requires some more interrupt-on-character capability tht isn''t in the current software. Hopefully this can get resolved, but it is backed up behind some other things.''(Thu, if you put in an AR on this, would you please append this message to the "description" field?)''Thanks,''Larry'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: le.pasaEdit-Date: 16-Apr-84 10':13':56Attn: JonL.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [tl':4/16/84 appended Larry''s comment]System: CommunicationsSubsystem: RS232Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: WishProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files:
