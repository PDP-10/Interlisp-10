The trick is to edit the function, then exit the editor (but with Deditlinger, the window is still up).  Then use shift-selection to type the desired expression into the BREAK window (or the top level).  This works well and has the advantage that none of the variables bound by DEDIT interfere with the evaluation of the expression.  (Also, you can easily see the history of your activity, whereas if you use the DEDIT EVAL command, you lose this information).   Maybe this technique should be documented in the manual?''--Tom'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sheilEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 18':59':59
