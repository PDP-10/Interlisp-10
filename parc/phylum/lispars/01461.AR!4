Writing to the floppy doesn''t even faze it': it seems'    to proceed according to the map of what it thinks'    is in the drive.  Rechecking the floppy when booting on'    a partition seems a much more reasonable way to proceed.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':05':36Attn: Assigned To: Roach.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: [DATE': 23-JUL-84 ROACH STATUS _ FIXED]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion FloppyMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
