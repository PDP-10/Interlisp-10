''...''a) Interlisp won''t talk with any printer that is running the Wabash software.  Why?  I don''t know.  Wabash is supposedly just like Spruce.  Wabash accepts files from a large number of sources, so I suspect the problem lies with us.  Since Wabash is becoming more popular in the Xerox world, this is something we should fix.  (Half the printers out here run it..)  Would the printer protocol wizard out there please contact me so we can fix this?''...'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 21-Jun-84 12':02':09
