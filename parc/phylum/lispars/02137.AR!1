Another is that when I use TELERAID from an older sysout, to snoop on a DLion running the currnet <LispCOre>Next> sysouts, it merely returns (from TELERAID) doing nothing except returning some random unprintable litatom.  Nope, doesn''t run any error.''-- JonL --''-----''From': masinter.pa'Date':  7-Sep-84 21':14':30 PDT'Subject': cross version Teleraid deson''doesn''t work'To': LispCore^''There''s a problem running TeleRaid between pre-array-bucket and post-array-bucket sysouts. The problem is that TeleRaid wants to initialize the value of variables that don''t exist. If you try to start up TeleRaid and it just pops back with an ERROR! out of the TELERAID call, try setting the variable RDPTRS to NIL and retry.''(before array-buckets, every sysout had a \FREEBLOCKLIST that TELERAID wanted to initialize, and now there''s \FREEBLOCKBUCKETS. The only reason that TELERAID wants those variables is in case you want to do a VPARSEARRAYSPACE to look at the remote guy''s array space. ''It is a misfeature that teleraid''s atom lookup routine ERROR!''s out rather than returning something.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
