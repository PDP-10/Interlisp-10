The variable FIRSTCOL is supposed to allow one to control the left margin of listings.''One is supposed to be able to use these in conjunction with the other elements of font profiles to construct readable listings.  Unfortunately, the values one sets up are overriden deep in the guts of the pretty-printer by the function COMPUTEPRETTYPARMS, which dumps in constant multiples of the linelength completely independent of the fonts in use.''This is serious as it is preventing me producing a quick work around for the LISTFILES element of the INTERPRESS/FONT problem.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 11':15':44</pre>
