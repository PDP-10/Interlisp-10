For example, if I''m doing a Put in an AR editor, I can''t type to other random text windows, such as a Lafite message composer.  Can''t do a Put in one AR editor and a Get in another.  This is quite annoying, as there is no obvious reason these operations should be mutually exclusive.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalskyEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 16':55':31
