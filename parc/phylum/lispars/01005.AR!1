I had a list of variables that I wanted to edit, so I tried the following':''(FOR U IN VARSTOCHANGE DO (DV U))''The result was that DV created n processes, one for each element of VARSTOCHANGE.  Further experimentation showed that when DV is given an argument whose value is an atom, it forks off a separate Dedit process rather than just calling Dedit in the current process.  This seems pretty weird to me!  I achieved my goal via''(FOR U IN VARSTOCHANGE DO (APPLY ''DV U))''But it seems like a mistake that people are bound to make.  In any case, it should be documented.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  7-May-84  9':37':59Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
