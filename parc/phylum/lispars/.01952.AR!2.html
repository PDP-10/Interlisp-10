I notice that the cursor does change to a right pointing before I enter the region where the scroll bar pops up, sot this is maybe a problem which can be fixed within TEDIT, i.e. shouldn''t it be the case that line/para size chunks get selected whenever the cursor has shifted to be a right pointing cursor and you selec left or middle.''Per-KristianWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 27-Aug-84 15':38':26</pre>
