The FB has two attached windows, both of whom scroll together; I''d like only one of them to have a scroll bar.'	Perhaps a new window property is in order': SCROLLBAR, a flag which determines the presence or absence of the little rascals.''		Herb''     ----- End Forwarded Messages -----'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 12':18':47Attn: Assigned To: Burton.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: ClosedProblem Type: Source Files:
