But simply "delver"ing -- deleting all but the last n versions  -- is no good since  the "last n" may all be minor deltas off some previous sourcefile, and all made within a short time period.  I suggest using LISPSOURCEFILEP to determine that a "delver" is inappropriate, and then reading the FILECREATED expression and parsing it to the "previous date':" file, so that one may delete all but the last n significant versions -- where the "significant" ones are those mentioned in FILECREATED expressions.  -- JonL -- 25-Sep-84Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 25-Sep-84 11':21':38</pre>
