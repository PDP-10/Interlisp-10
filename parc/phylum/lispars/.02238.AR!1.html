For instance, as a result of repeated Brownie''ing {Phylum/Eris}&lt;Lisp&gt;Current&gt; into {Ice}&lt;Lisp&gt;Current&gt; over time a lot of files in the latter directory are now obsolete. ''I propose the option PURGE as follows':'	(COPYFILES	''{Eris}&lt;Lisp&gt;Current&gt;'				''{Ice}&lt;Lisp&gt;Current&gt;'				''(&gt;A PURGE))''updates the destination dir from the source dir with all obsolete files purged.''-- Hans'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
