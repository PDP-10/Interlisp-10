This means that if you use LAFITEFIND to select a subset and are Display-ing your way through them, Answer will reply to some random message rather than to the one you are currently reading.'I only marked this "Serious" because I''ve several times sent random messages off and gotten puzzled replies from people.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 25-Jul-84 13':16':55Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
