However, the system dies in interesting ways if NIL has a non-NIL definition. I propose making PUTD give an error if NIL has a definition.''On the other hand (I''ve already sent another message on this, to LispSupport), there  is no reason why NIL can''t have a property list. CDR(NIL) and GETPROPLIST(NIL) are two separate entities in Interlisp-D, and we can I think gracefully diverge with Interlisp-10 on this particular one, because I don''t think it will affect any part of the system.'''[I''m working on some performance tuning of Reduce written in StandardLispInInterlisp in preparation for a visit by some folks from Rand, if you are wondering what is prompting this otherwise unnecessary upheavals. I got screwed by one of their functions that did a PUTD(NIL (LAMBDA ---)) when given faulty args because WINDOW.MOUSE.HANDLER apparently doesn''t do too well if NIL has a definition. ]''-----''Date': 15 Apr 84 14':18 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': PUTD(NIL (LAMBDA --)) works, but can crash system'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 15 Apr 84 12':53 PST'To': Masinter.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa, LispCore^.pa''Some comparisons from the MacLisp/CommonLisp world':''T and NIL have always had propertylists -- the introduction into MacLisp of PLIST and SETPLIST (by 1970, I believe) were to prevent any identification of these functions with CDR and RPLACD.''T and NIL (NIL, r.i.p.!) are special-cased for value, and can''t be used as variables.''T and NIL are *alleged* to be reasonable funciton names (by the CommonLisp manual and the LispMachineLisp manual), but in fact NIL won''t work': it dies in DEFUN on the LispMachine (with an erroneous error msg) and the MacLisp interpreter and compiler explicitly disallow NIL as a function name, even though DEFUN will "do the right thing".''-----''Date': 18 Apr 84 17':29 PST'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': PUTD(NIL (LAMBDA --)) works, but can crash system'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 15 Apr 84 14':18 PST'To': JonL.pa'cc': Masinter.pa, LispSupport.pa''I made PUTD(NIL anything) cause an error.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 18':43':47
