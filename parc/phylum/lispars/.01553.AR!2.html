Of course there are several things in Bravox that you can''t do in TEdit, but as the need arises, those I assume will be either added in, or deliberately left out.''One particular need has come up for us in Pasadena.  We are constantly writing proposals.  "It would be nice if" one could put headers on pages.  That is, be able to specify a string such that when the TEdit stream is printed out, the string appears at the top or bottom of every page.  Is that already implemented somehow?  Would it be possible to add it?''--Ken.''-----''mjs 6/28''Subject': Re': TEdit': Headers would be nice??'In-reply-to': Feuerman.pasa''s message of 26 Jun 84 16':51 PDT'To': Feuerman.pasa'cc': TEditSupport''I believe that John Sybalsky has been working on page formatting, including headers and page numbers.
