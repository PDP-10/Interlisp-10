(Communications/NS). Description': The Xerox NS protocols have changed to not require the ability to read passwords from the server, but rather to implement a more reasonable authentication protocol. Probably other changes have been made as well, e.g., the packet exchange protocol. The first task is to make sure that Interlisp-D will play properly with Services 8.0. The second task is to read carefully the release documentation and submit the ARs of what we have to do to take advantage of any new network services.
