If I make a type there, I hit the top blank (TB) key, which undoes the last typing. If I don''t notice that error and type the corrected characters, or if the typo is a roll-over with TB followed by a correct BS, there is no way to get back all the "undone" typing. This has happened enough that I find it a serious problem.''Suggestion': use the bottom blank key for undo, which rolls over to the mode key RSHIFT; make the TB key do nothing, or maybe even do BS, so as to make BS easier to hit.''Question': Can I do this myself by "rewiring" the keys?

Neither of us seem to lose from this very often, but we have seen this complaint repeatedly. Hence, we will bow to the vox populi (sp? ).  It is not clear whether we want to move the key, or change the event that makes typein an atomic event (and hence subject to undo and, desirably, redo).  But you will get a solution.''Greg''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Jul-84 12':05':52Attn: Sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
