When BFS Test encounters an error three or more times, during the disk certify, it will map it out at the end.  In about 90% of the cases this works fine.  We run into trouble when BFS Test says a bad spot has been marked, and Scavenger continues to find this spot bad (after a complete disk software loadup.)  Scavenger will usually complain that it as encountered a "Hard Disk Error", and that the page was "Incorrigible".  Some of these disk drives have been sent back to Shugart for media replacement, but Shugart claims the disks meet specifications.''Could anyone give me an idea of what is taking place during the BFS Certify?'Are there certain types of disk errors that can''t be mapped out?''Any information or possible solutions to this continuing problem, will be greatly appreciated, since there are many unusable disk drives being endlessly recycled, and kept out of circulation.''Tom Logan''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 13':14':22</pre>
