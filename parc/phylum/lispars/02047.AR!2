When the caret is originally outside the window, the text scrolls reasonably appropriately by making the first line of the window be the line containing the caret.  But even though we scroll to the right place, the caret is nowhere to be seen.  I see this a lot in TEDIT searching for example.  You search for a string outside the visible window, TEDIT scrolls to the right place, but there isn''t a flashing caret.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':17':27
