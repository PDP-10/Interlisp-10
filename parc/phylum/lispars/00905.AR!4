The underline is hard to find, and if it doesn''t have to redisplay you don''t notice when it''s done.  It also might be nice to have it create a pending-delete selection, both for visibility and replacement convenience.''david'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':50':16Attn: Assigned To: SybalskyIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
