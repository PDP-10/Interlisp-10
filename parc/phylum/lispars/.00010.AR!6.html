It will compile the synopsis but'stash it in a hashfile rather than on the property list.''This "compilation" process is somewhat similar to the analysis that the'extension to SINGLEFILEINDEX does -- I''m wondering if the lower-level'support ought not to go into the system (in FILEPKG).'''Incidentally, I forgot to mention that the one lacuna in LISPSOURCEFILEP is'this': a non-RANDACCESSP file *** which is already OPENP *** can''t be hacked.'A little thought about lacunae in NS filing will show why (GETFILEPTR 'fails, in addition to SETFILEPTR''s problems).'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 27-Jun-84 14':02':30Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ImpossibleFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: MISC</pre>
