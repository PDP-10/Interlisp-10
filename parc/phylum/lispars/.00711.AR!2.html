In the TOPS20 case, it is CRLF at remote site.''- JonL - ' 'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Apr-84 18':45':36Attn: JonL.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: RS232Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
