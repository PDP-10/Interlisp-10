Lisp asks you for the connect password for lisp, and then it breaks with "FILE WON''T OPEN': {phylum}<lisp>...".  This is very strange because you can MAKEFILE to the directory (after giving the password).  Perhaps COPYFILE is not passing the password info correctly?''-----''Date':  2 APR 84 17':57 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': earlier troubles with COPYFILE'To':   LispSupport'cc':   vanMelle''Date':  8 MAR 84 19':33 PST'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': Re': <Lisp> directory'To':   masinter, LispCore^'cc':   ROACH''In response to the message sent   8 Mar 84 15':47 PST from masinter.pa''     There is no way to PUPFTP to <LISP> from MAXC.
