It is in'<SHULMAN.XEROX>PRINTOUT.  When you are satisfied with them you should'replace the stuff in DWIM with these.''The new things are':''	* PRINTPARA now uses pixel positioning when printing to displaystreams.'	* Bitmaps are now incorporated as a printout form.  This new form'	  is .BM <before> <descent> <bitmap> which is implemented by the'	  function PRINTBM.  <before> is the amount to scroll up the'	  displaystream before bitmap is displayed.  NIL means don''t'	  scroll, T means scroll the amount the bitmap extends above the'	  top of the current line, a number means scroll that amount above'	  the top of the current line. <descent> is how far below the current'	  line to BITBLT the bitmap.  The window is scrolled up if there is'	  not enough room.  The following line printed will be printed so'	  it doesn''t overlap the bitmap.  NIL means don''t descend, a number'	  means descend that amount.  <bitmap> is the bitmap to print.''	  The displaystream is left at the same Y position it was before the'	  BITBLT and advanced the width of the bitmap.  If the bitmap is'	  too wide to fit a new line is generated.'''Let me know what you think.''							Jeff'-------''Date': 28 Mar 84 18':05 PST'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': [Wogulis.pasa': New PRINTOUT functions]'In-reply-to': Sannella.pa''s message of 28 Mar 84 13':53 PST'To': Sannella.pa'cc': Kaplan.pa, Masinter.pa''In general, we would like 1100Support to graciously accept LispUsers packages from users and redistribute them if they have any semblance of being reasonably useful.
