Having it return to the top will also call attention to it.''-----''Date':  2 Apr 84 14':16 PST'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': AR 441': Want break window brought to top after editing fn from backtrace menu'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 2 Apr 84 09':41':26 PST (Monday)'To': LispSupport.pa''I am planning on changing it so that the cursor will always be visible.
