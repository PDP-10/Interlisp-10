Number: 391Date: 29-Mar-84 19':30':29Submitter: le.pasaSource: Barrera.pasaSubject: Modifying Tedit and Lafite for a LOCALPRINTERLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 29 Mar 84 11':04 PST'From': Barrera.pasa'Subject': Modifying Tedit and Lafite for a LOCALPRINTER'To': Le.pasa'cc': Sybalsky.pa, Raim, Barrera ''I am currently modifying the PRINTER and FXPRINTER packages, which provide an interface for the Epson FX80 desk-top printer, to allow a LOCALPRINTER (namely the FX80) to be the default printing host.''This has been accomplished for the most part, with the exception of Tedit files, Press files and Lafite files.  After making the change shown in the next paragraph, Tedit and Press files print on the printer, but write a lot of garbage; Lafite files don''t print anything at all, but write "(Hardcopy complete)" in the Prompt window.'''I believe I have located the source of error to be in the TEDIT.HARDCOPY function.  In order to avoid a "Can''t print TEDIT documents on a LOCALPRINTER printer." error, a new list must be added to the SELECTQ of the form':''(LOCALPRINTER 				(* Send it to an LOCALPRINTER printer) ''	(TEDIT.PRESS.HARDCOPY STREAM FILE DONTSEND BREAKPAGETITLE)).''''If a new function were written, say TEDIT.LOCAL.HARDCOPY, (to substitute for TEDIT.PRESS.HARDCOPY in the above expression) that would convert these files to a form acceptable to a local printer, then these packages would work for Tedit and Lafite hardcopies, as well.''Stephanie'-------------------------'Date': 29 Mar 84 18':19':30 PST (Thursday)'From': masinter.PA'Subject': AR#391, Tedit and Lafite for a LOCALPRINTER''We''ve had some call for the new Xerox color matrix printers, Versatecs, etc..''Ed McGoldrick also showed me some output from Gould, where they had changed the LISTFILES code to use one of their color printers, with function names in red, comments in blue, etc.''We''ve gotten a request from Siemens for us to support the Siemens ink-jet printer, which has the advantage of being 72 dots/inch, the same as the screen resolution and I think better than the FX-80.''--------------------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  3-Apr-84 12':07':28Attn: Sybalsky.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [tl': 3/29/84 added on some correction--CORRECTION':  Lafite files also write a lot of garbage to the printer]'[tl': 3/30/84 added Masinter solutions'-------'There are two ways of handling LOCALPRINTER from TEDIT, I think.''The first is to use the printer in ''bitmap'' mode; i.e., use the internal Lisp fonts and just send it in dotmatrix mode. This may need some work to get it to run fast. It may not work if the printer doesn''t have enough resolution. (I think that the Siemens printer which is a high-resolution ink-jet might.)''The other way is to acquire the FONTS.WIDTHS of the built-in fonts for the local printer, and map the screen fonts onto that. That wouldn''t give you a direct screen-printer mapping, but it might be faster and, just because of 'that, more acceptable.''-------------]'System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: WishProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
