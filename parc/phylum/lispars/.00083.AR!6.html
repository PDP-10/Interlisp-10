This feature has never done anything but clobber me.'---------'Date': 16 MAR 84 15':32 PST'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': Re': AR#83'To':   masinter'cc':   ROACH''In response to your message sent  15 Mar 84 00':38 PST''     Typically I may LOADFNS the filecoms &amp; maybe other stuff off'a filepackage file F.  I LOAD some other file which redefines'functions in F &amp; maybe do some Dediting.  At this point, all that'is needed to MAKEFILE F is in core.  I do a MAKEFILE of F and F'gets LOADed in, erasing my work.'				Kelly'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 22':12':21Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: MasinterIn/By: Disposition: [lmm': 16Mar, append Roach msg, change title, assigned priority/difficulty]17 Aug Fixed - lmm, see prev message to LispCore.
