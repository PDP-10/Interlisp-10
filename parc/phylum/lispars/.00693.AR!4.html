I''ve been having trouble using the FileBrowser to delete files from {DSK}.  (I''m assuming that the correct procedure for deleting files is to mark the files to be deleted using "Delete", followed by an "Expunge".)  Usually none of the marked files get deleted, though occasionally a few of the marked files - maybe 50% - are removed.  Is this a known bug with using a {DSK} volume on a Dandelion?''-- Sandy''-----''Sender': Sannella.PA'Date': 13 Apr 84 13':45':45 PST (Friday)'Subject': AR 693': FileBrowser not deleting files from {DSK} on DLion'To': SKobayashi.es'cc': LispSupport.pa, jellinek.pa'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''No, This is not a known bug.  I assume that the {DSK} you are talking about is a "core device" {DSK}, as compared to a real physical volume DSK on your DLion.  If you are using the Dion local file system, all bets are off --- we have withdrawn the local file system from the Lisp Library.''-----''Date': 13 Apr 84 15':39':47 PST (Friday)'From': SKobayashi.es'Subject': Re': AR 693': FileBrowser not deleting files from {DSK} on DLion'In-reply-to': Sannella.PA''s message of 13 Apr 84 13':45':45 PST (Friday)'To': LispSupport.pa, Sannella.pa'cc': SKobayashi.es''Mike --''I''m sorry that I didn''t make things clear. I have a logical volume on my Dandelion, named DSK. When I formatted my Dandelion, I created a DSK volume as well as a Lisp volume - both of type, normal.''Re': ... we have withdrawn the local file system from the Lisp Library.'Does this mean that you are no longer supporting a rigid disk system for the 1108 (that was announced in the Carol release message)? Then I suppose you don''t want to hear about the problem I have with files disappearing off {DSK} between logouts?''-- Sandy''-----''Subject': AR 693': FileBrowser not deleting files from {DSK}on DLion'To': SKobayashi.es'cc': Jellinek, Sheil, Stansbury, Masinter'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa'''Larry Masinter has already answered about the withdrawal of the DLion local file system package (DLIONFS).  However, looking at your answer of 13 Apr 84, I have realized that this is not your problem at all.  In fact, I doubt that you are using DLIONFS at all.''If you do not have DLIONFS loaded into Interlisp-D on a DLion, then opening a file on {DSK} will automatically create a "Core device" {DSK} in the virtual memory of your Interlisp-D.  Until recently, we had a problem where files on core devices disappeared between logouts, so this is why I suspect that this is what is happening to you.  New sysouts with a fix to this disappearing-files-on-logout  bug were recently announced to LispUsers&uarr;.pa (ask your local Interlisp Liason if they have been transfered down there yet).''To test my diagnosis, try the following, and tell me if my prediction is not correct':''1) Have you loaded DLIONFS (test': (GETPROPLIST ''DLIONFS)#NIL)?  I predict no.'2) Do any of the {DSK} files you create from within Interlisp actually appear after logout (using mesa tools) on your DLion local {DSK} volume?  I predict no.''In spite of all of the misunderstandings, I think that your original complaint (FileBrowser not deleting files from {DSK} on DLion) is still valid.  I will keep you informed of the progress on this problem.''-----''Date': 17 Apr 84 21':18':21 PST (Tuesday)'From': SKobayashi.es'Subject': Re': AR 693': FileBrowser not deleting files from {DSK}on DLion'In-reply-to': Sannella.PA''s message of 17 Apr 84 13':30':09 PST (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': SKobayashi.es''Re': Mike Sannella''s predictions''1) Have you loaded DLIONFS (test': (GETPROPLIST ''DLIONFS)#NIL)?
