Thus it is 'unrecoverable unless you are enough of a wizard to know how to use (OPENWINDOWS)'or whatever the function was, to get it back.''I believe this occurred when I shrank a window which was positioned so that'its lower parts were actually off the bottom of the screen (but the upper 'parts still on it). Let me know if that fails to reproduce it.''JG'-----'Date': 19 Mar 84 17':56 PST'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': AR 195': SHRINK can place icon off screen'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 19 Mar 84 17':31':07 PST (Monday)'To': LispSupport.pa''Has been fixed.
