This should be half the space and many times the speed of the current format.  It does not do any compression.''The relevant functions are \PRINTBINARYBITMAP and \READBINARYBITMAP on IMAGEOBJ.  I changed the name of the GETFN for new bitmap imageobjs to be BM.GETFN2 and left BM.GETFN around so old bitmaps will be converted as they are encountered.''richard''-----''Date': 17 Jul 84 14':29 PDT'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': bitmap objects'In-reply-to': Burton.pa''s message of 17 Jul 84 11':53 PDT'To': Burton.pa'cc':  teditsupport.pa''Took a look at your  implementation and that''s basically what I had in mind.  The only suggestion I would make is to not store the raster width out on the file.  Currently, you store it and then check to see that the number you stored when you read it in is the same as the number you would compute from the other paramters of the bitmap.  Seems funny to have that particular redundancy--what if we changed the internal format of bitmaps at some future point, which might make the rasterwidth meaningless.  Is a redundancy check really necessary?''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 18-Aug-84 11':19':36
