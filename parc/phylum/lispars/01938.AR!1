Thus if you have the caret at  point  A in the file and you button  right  at B the region between A and B will be selected.  However,  if you push CTRL and then button right at B the region between A and B is not CTRL-selected.  In fact no region at all gets selected.  I''d like it if the typical idiom for selection was extended to cover CTRL- (and CTRL-shift)  selection.''Per-KristianWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
