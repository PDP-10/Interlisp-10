That protection does not affect the creation of files, apparently, but new versions inherit the protection of the previous version, and so cannot be deleted.  I suspect the only way to delete such files is to chat to the server, connect to <Lisp>, change the file''s protection, then delete it.  Thus the only thing Lisp''s DELFILE can reasonably do is return NIL.''So change AR':''Subject': DELFILE of a file write-protected against owner hangs'System': communications'Subsystem': Pup protocols'Attn': vanMelle'Impact': Annoying'Problem Type': Bug'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 22-May-84 15':11':43
