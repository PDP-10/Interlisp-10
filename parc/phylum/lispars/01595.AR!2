This should be a list of fns that should NEVER be modified by a user (i.e. never allowed to be DEFINEQ''d).  Examples are QUOTE or PUTDQ or GETPROP.  This would be a good list to hand out to our other customers under the heading of "things that you should never even consider doing."''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Jul-84 14':22':47Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: DocumentationSubsystem: Interlisp Reference ManualMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
