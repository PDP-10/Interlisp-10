In general, in the distributed environment, "creation date" refers to the last time content changed, while "write date" refers to the date when the contents got recorded on the particular medium. This is a reinterpretation of "write date" from what it used to mean in the time-sharing environment when things didn''t move from one place to another.''I can understand how Dolphin/Dorado users object to having new microcode supposedly affecting content when it doesn''t for them, but I think that its a pretty weak case.''We made it so that rewriting the file map doesn''t change the creationdate, and that seems this side of the edge, since one could argue that the filemap is completely derived information. I don''t think, for example, that running HITATOMS should leave creationdate unchanged, and splicing new microcode seems like it really does change content.''Did he splice it or did he not? When did it get spliced? Is this a version before or after splicing?''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
