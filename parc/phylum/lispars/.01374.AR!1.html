Number: 1374Date:  8-Jun-84  9':55':43Submitter: WallaceSource: WallaceSubject: Inspecting the advice of a fn should just display it, not call Dedit on it.Lisp Version:  3-Jun-84 16':29':06Description: In my environment LOGOUT has a function definition which is advised.  I wished to look at this advice, so I did (INSPECT ''LOGOUT).  This spawned a process which asked me "Which defn?" (or something like that).  In any case,  I selected ADVICE, persuming that I would see the advice of LOGOUT.  WHat I found is that I was in a Dedit of the advice!''So two problems':'1&gt; I didn''t want to be in DEdit; I just wanted to see the advice.'2&gt; This is a way to get two DEdit''s which is supposedly not so hot an idea. (since the (INSPECT ...) returns I could do DF foo.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-Jun-84  9':55':43Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: LibraryMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
