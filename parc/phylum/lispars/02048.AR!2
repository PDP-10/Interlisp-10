I get prompted in one window for a connect password to Phylum. I don''t care about the connect password to Phylum, I want to change my whole user login. I can''t get in in any other process to call LOGIN because of the monitor lock on logging in.''I don''t think a monitor lock is appropriate or a good idea here; what bad would happen if we just took it out?Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':18':50
