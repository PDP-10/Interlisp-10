This increases the line height and hence the height of this whole area of the menu.  Consequently, one cannot have the ruler/margin bar and the APPLY/SHOW buttons visible until the bold numbers are deleted.''The only work-around I have found is to create a small TEdit window, open the extended menu, and then reshape into a much larger window.  This causes the extended menu to be somewhat larger than the default size.''Some deterministic method for changing the extended menu size would also be useful.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':32':22
