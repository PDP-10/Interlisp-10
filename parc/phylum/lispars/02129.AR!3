The documentation, and comparison with the DREVERSE example - (SMASH . PPE) - suggest that the correct template is simply PPE.  However, this is rejected as an invalid template.  (! CALL . PPE) is acceptable, but on retrieval becomes plain PPE.  Thus my code has to kludge it back into shape between GET and SET.'---------Sender': Bird.pasa'To': Le.pasa'From': Bird.pasa'Subject': RE': Recent Template AR-Submit'cc': 1100Support.pasa, Bird.pasa''This is more of a problem than I first thought.  Since GETTEMPLATE and SETTEMPLATE are used by the file package, I get an error loading files containing PPE templates that the file package produced from my (! CALL . PPE) versions.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 13':20':58
