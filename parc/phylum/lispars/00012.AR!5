The connection was slow and I got offered the window to abort the connection.  I left it alone and eventually the file finished loading with a few "[ice not responding]" messages.   About 15 seconds after the file finished loading, an "[ice not responding]" message appeared in the promptwindow.  About a minute later a window appearred, offering a chance to abort the connection to Ice.  About a minute later, the ICE#LEAF process went away.  Is there some way of avoiding the bogus error messages?''richard' '-----''Date': 22 Mar 84 09':40 PST'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Lisp': Init asks for file QXZRYU.WJK'To': LispSupport.pa''Lisp-System-Date': 15-Mar-84 00':13':18'Machine-Type': Dolphin''While starting up the new FULL.SYSOUT, I got a message (during the init/greet phase) telling me that Phylum was not responding for the file {PHYLUM}<SHEIL>QXZRYU.WJK.''My init and greet files dont ask for such a file (and indeed, there isn''t one).''What''s going on here?''Beau''-----''Date': 22 Mar 84 12':35 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Init asks for file QXZRYU.WJK'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 22 Mar 84 12':16':16 PST (Thursday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': LispCore^.pa, Masinter.pa, Sheil''It''s a kludge used to implement DIRECTORYNAMEP.''This is related to AR 12, whose general problem is': Leaf should not give "not responding" messages on non-user visible operations, such as internal closes and the funny file name for DIRECTORYNAMEP.''	Bill''-----''Date': 26 MAR 84 16':30 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': Re': Lisp': Init asks for file QXZRYU.WJK'To':   Sheil, LispSupport'cc':   JONL''In response to the message sent  22 Mar 84 09':40 PST from Sheil.pa''When I tried to LOADFROM a file on [Phylum], and [Phylum] was heavily loaded,'I got a similar nonsense message -- [PHYLUM not responding for {Phylum}<LISPCORE>LIBRARY>QXZRYU.WJK]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.paEdit-Date: 27-Mar-84  9':32':27Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: PUP ProtocolsMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: IFSServer Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: OnceImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
