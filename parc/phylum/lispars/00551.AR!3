The problem is, this form gets run on a HARDRESET to clean up after the process, at which point the (THIS.PROCESS) you were thinking of is no longer.  The resetsave should instead be something like (RESETSAVE NIL (LIST ''PROCESS.WINDOW (THIS.PROCESS) oldWindow)), so that the form contains the affected process directly, rather than relying on (THIS.PROCESS) to be correct.''(An alternative strategy is for PROC to temporarily resurrect each dead process just long enough to run their resetforms, probably a good idea anyway, but this is harder, and not necessary to fix this problem.)'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 20-Jun-84 15':30':50Attn: Assigned To: sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
