Their windows pop to top when their carets flash while normal windows (e.g. "Top level typescript window") do not.  This seems to be a pretty good feature.  I think CHAT & TEDIT should either switch to WINDOW package carets, or imitate them better.''------'Date': 23 Aug 84 12':30 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1865': CHAT & TEDIT carets...'To': Roach'cc': vanMelle.pa, Sybalsky''Chat uses the same caret mechanism as the top-level tty': it pops its window to the top only if it is necessary to do so in order to expose the caret.''Thus, I am marking this AR strictly a Tedit problem.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 23-Aug-84 12':31':07
