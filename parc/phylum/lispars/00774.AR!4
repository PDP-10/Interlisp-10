It looks'like the IOP wants some of that preciious page 0 stuff that'Kelly needed for his floppy code.''I need about 16 words  (that should cover most types of IOCBs'and other things that RS232 can receive)  Are there 16 words'to spare?  If not, (Kelly) is there anything I can do to check'if FLOPPY is using those words, so I can go in and use them?  (I hope'it doesn''t come to that, since it will cause problems using both FLOPPY 'and the RS232 stuff at the same time).''Thanks,''/Mitch.''-----''Date': 25 Apr 84 17':24 PST'From': Roach.pa'Subject': AR774'To': LISPSUPPORT''     I already sent a message back to Mitch & recipients of the original msg describing 16 words next to FLOPPY''s 16 words that should be available for RS232.  I''ve deleted my original response, maybe one of the other recipients still has it.  Status _ Fixed.'					Kelly'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':08':05Attn: Assigned To: RoachIn/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion FloppyMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
