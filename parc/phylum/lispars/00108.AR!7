Arg to PUTHASH is a HARRAYP which has 80 elements in it.  It appears the stats code was modified to use (HARRAY &) instead of (LIST (HARRAY &)) for its hash arrays.  But wasn''t the growing harray stuff withdrawn?  If yes, why wasn''t the change to stats withdrawn?  If no, why isn''t this hash array automatically growing?''	Bill''-----''Date':  8 Mar 84 17':53 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': STATS broken'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 8 Mar 84 14':38 PST'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': Kaplan.pa, LispSupport.pa''The changed implementation of the new hasharrays WAS withdrawn--but that change to STATS apparently was missed in the withdrawal.  Sorry about that.''Actually, a new interface was installed (after the new implementation and after I had editted lots of code to take out the extra LISTs but before its withdrawal) which doesn''t depend on changing the semantics of HARRAY.  I think this was suggested in one of the Monday meetings.  In the interface, which exists now and will quietly upgrade to the new implementation, the function HASHARRAY is the one that defaults to a growing hash array.  It currently returns (CONS (HARRAY )), but in the next week or so will start returning a growable hasharray datum.''Thus, the fix in STATS, which I will try to do tonight, is to replace that HARRAY with HASHARRAY, sans LIST or CONS.''Again, Sorry.''--Ron''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  8-May-84 17':19':32Attn: Assigned To: Kaplan.paIn/By: Fugue.6 (9-Apr-84)Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Performance ToolsMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
