FIELDTYPE)Lisp Version: carol>full.sysoutDescription: ''On page 3.7 of my October 1983 Interlisp Reference Manual the format for specifying fieldtypes to DATATYPE is given as (FIELDNAME . FIELDTYPE).  Experimentation suggests that the format acceptable to the software is (FIELDNAME FIELDTYPE) - i.e. a list rather than a CONSed pair.''The documentation is similar for other record types but I haven''t checked the software.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 13-Aug-84  9':16':44Attn: lispAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Record PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: Status: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
