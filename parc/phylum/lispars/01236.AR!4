There is a compiled call to FREPLACEFIELD in the code. Do you know how this happened, and can we track it down? This is potentially quite serious!''Larry''-----''Date': 22 May 84 20':36 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': brain damage in the compiled code for MKSTRING'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 22 May 84 18':53 PDT'To': Masinter.pa'cc': jonl.pa, kaplan.pa, LispCore^, LispSupport.pa''GLAAG, the problem is serious and extensive.  It appears as though every file compiled between roughly third week of April and about May 12 has some form of brain-damage.  ''By MAPATOMS''ing in the May 14 sysout, I''ve found dozens of other functions that have compiled calls to FREPLACEFIELD, and I''ve prepared a summary of what files they are on, along with the file dates, on [Phylum]<LispCore>Sources>REPLACEFIELDLOSERS.''[LispCore^': Larry noticed that there was a compiled call to FREPLACEFIELD in MKSTRING;  I BCOMPL''d LLCHAR, and it went away. Suspicion that the OPENLAMBDA bug prevalent during those three weeks not only acounts for most of the losers in REPLACEFIELDLOSERS, but could also be responsible for other, as yet undiscovered, lossages]''-- JonL --'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 17':57':29
