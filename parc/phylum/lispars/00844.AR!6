If the user in the meantime has told the remote host that her terminal type is different, then this sets it back--clearly the wrong thing to do.''Workaround': Set CHAT.DISPLAYTYPE to the correct value for the host that you are chatting to.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 10':18':17
