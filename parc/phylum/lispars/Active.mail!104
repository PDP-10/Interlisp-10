I would like to add severalfeatures, but I'm having difficulty:	(1) I would like to give the new userexec process the tty processimmediately, and it seems a way to do this is to do a (GIVE.TTYPROCESS tothe new process's window.  Doing the ADD.PRCESS creates and automaticallyopens a TTY window for the process, but doing a (PROCESSPROP process 'WINDOW)returns NIL, and looking in inspect window also show PROCWINDOW to beNIL.  What does this mean?	(2) OKay, so I thought I could define my own window by adding theprop-value pair 'WINDOW mywindow to  the ADD.PROCESS call; this createstwo windows (my test was (ADD.PROCESS '(USEREXEC) 'WINDOW (CREATEW ] ).BUTTONING EITHER WINDOW GIVES THE TTY PORCESS TO THE USEREXEC, BUT YOU CANONLY TYPE IN THE TTY WINDOW CREATED BY LISP.  HOWEVER, THE PROCWINDOW FORTHE PROCESS IS INDEED THE ONE I CREATED.  PERHAPS, THIS IS BEHAVIOR ISEXPLAINIED IN THE MANUAL.  IF SO , PLEASE POINT THE WAY.	(3) I WOULD also like the WINDOW so I can close it after the userexecreturns (BY TYPING OK) or after the process is killed. The default is thewindow just sits there, and I think that's a bit deceiving.  thanks,Mark------------*start*01353 00024 US Date: 13 Aug 84 17:46 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: [Christopher Lane <LANE@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA>: Re: hash]To: LispSupport, 1100Supportcc: Lane@sumexPlease make sure "HASH" is included in the packages release.

I dunno if this belongs on the Lisp end or the VAX end, but I suspect it is better to put it on the VAX end.Unix:The UNIX operating system's facility for handling files posed two obstacles for ISI-INTERLISP.  First, the UNIX systemdoes not save old files which have been updated.  All new files supersede their old versions in the user's  directory.  Second, the UNIX system recognizes distinct file names of only14 characters or less; any longer names are truncated by the UNIX system  to fit this  format.The UNIX operating system's file names are really pointers to files, which means that a file can have more than one name.  ISI-INTERLISP uses this feature to save old versions of files as new ones are created.  When a file is updated, ISI-INTERLISP designates it as a new file and gives it an appropriate version number.  It also passes along to each updated file an unnumbered name, so that the latest version of the file always has two names assigned to it, one numbered and one unnumbered.  The UNIX operating system recognizes the unnumbered names but not the numbered ones, so any manipulation of older versions of files must be done in Interlisp.Under Berkeley Unix 4.1, to be able to handle numbered files at the UNIX shell level, one must use the special versions of @IIT(csh) and @IIT(ls) provided with ISI-INTERLISP. Setting the environment variable VERSIONS in the modified C shell causes the shell to pass the "true" names of files to programs rather than the names with characters truncated to 7 bits.  Typing "setenv VERSIONS n", where n is an integer, allows the new ls to print the file names as "filename;versionnumber".Under 4.1, Interlisp implements the version number by setting the high order bit of the last character of the file name.  This convention limits the length of file names to 13 characters, since one character must be reserved for version numbers.  However, if the file is a .v (binary) file, or if the FORCEEXT flag is set to T, the file name is truncated to the first 11 characters to allow room for the extension as well as the version number.This method of handling version numbers is unnecessary under Berkely Unix 4.2.The UNIX operating system also, by nature, distinguishes between upper- and lower- case characters in file names.  ISI-INTERLISP, however, recognizes either upper  or lower case and will match the upper or lower case pattern of the previous version when creating new files. VMSUnder VMS, no special handling is required for version numbers since this is taken care of by the operating system.  VMS permits two forms of punctuation in directory names: [DIRECTORY] and <DIRECTORY>.  Due to the difficulty of typein for "[]" style punctuation under Interlisp (since, by default, these characters represent meta-open and meta-close, they must be preceded by the escape character "%"), users of ISI-INTERLISP under VMS are encouraged to adopt "<" and ">" for directory name punctuation.  In fact, internally ISI-INTERLISP will convert to this form under most circumstances.Manipulating File NamesThe directory structure of the UNIX operating system is represented by separating the names of successive directories leading to the intended file by slashes (e.g., /usr/Interlisp/foo).  A user can change a TENEX or TOPS-20 -type file name to this format by using the following function:(TRANSLATEFILENAME FILENAME)uses the alist FILENAMETRANSLATIONS to direct the translation of all or specific fields of FILENAME.The entries of FILENAMETRANSLATIONS can be any of the field names known to UNPACKFILENAME, plus the following:FIRST		Each form in FIRST is evaluated before any other processing is done. FILENAME and FILENAMETRANSLATIONS are bound to the file name and to the whole translation list, respectively.FULLNAME	A list of dotted pairs of full path names.  If the CAR of any of these pairs matches FILENAME, the corresponding CDR is returned as the translation.HOST, DEVICE, DIRECTORY, NAME, EXTENSION, VERSION	Each of these is a list of dotted pairs, which are matched with the corresponding fields as returned byUNPACKFILENAME.  If any CAR matches the input, the CDR replaces it.LAST	After all changes have been made, each form in LAST is evaluated.Below is a sample showing the recommended format for setting FILENAMETRANSLATIONS.(SETQQ FILENAMETRANSLATIONS  ((DIRECTORY (DDYER . /lisp/ddyer/lisp)              (VORECK . /lisp/voreck/lisp)              (RBATES . /lisp/rbates/lisp)              (IGNATOWSKI . /lisp/ignatowski/lisp)              (LISPUSERS . /lisp/Interlisp/lispusers))   (EXTENSION (COM . v))   (NAME (MACHINEINDEPENDENT . machine)         (FOO . newfoo))   (LAST (SETQ FILENAME            (PACKFILENAME (QUOTE VERSION) NIL (QUOTE BODY) FILENAME]With this format, if  FILENAME="<IGNATOWSKI>FOO.COM.3", TRANSLATEFILENAME would produce "/lisp/ignatowski/lisp/newfoo.v".FILENAME can also be a list of a file name's properties as returned by UNPACKFILENAME, in which case it would return that list with the changes according to FILENAMETRANSLATIONS.  ¬   

We would like you to use it in place of the current one before it is released to the un-friendly world.  Its stored as {ERIS}<LISPCORE>LIBRARY>GRAPHER.DCOMIt should help cure your array space problems.  The old Grapher created a bitmap per node.  This one doesn't.  The price is that scrolling may take a little longer.  To REDISPLAYW a very large graph takes twice as long as it used to, but I think you will find it acceptable (if you don't like this, set CACHE/NODE/LABEL/BITMAPS/FLG to T).  Also, the GRAPHRECORD was changed to burn half as many cons cells.  Fortunately, you do not have to recompile, since all the old fields that are advertised for public use were left in their old positions.LAYOUTGRAPH takes a new format token.  Adding REVERSE/DAUGHTERS to the list of format items will reflect horizontal graphs vertically, and vertical graphs horizontally.If you run in Harmony, then (HARDCOPYGRAPH <graph> <file> <imageType> <translation>) will produce a file from a formated graph (e.g., like SHOWGRAPH, only for files).  Currently, it only works for PRESS files.  Interpress files will be coming soon.  If the device field of the file name is LPT, the file will automatically get sent to the appropriate printer.  ImageType is, of course, either PRESS or INTERPRESS, and defaults to INTERPRESS.  Translation is a position in screen points of the lower left corner of the graph from the lower left corner of the piece of paper.  HARDCOPYGRAPH will go away when device-independent graphics comes.  People who want to print more than a single graph on a file can see the definition of HARDCOPYGRAPH. -- Ron & Kurt*start*00360 00024 US Date: 17 Aug 84 16:45:51 PDT (Friday)From: LRosenberg.PASubject: Starting With LispTo: LispUsers^.PAcc: , LRosenbergReply-To: LRosenberg.PAI am a newhire who is very interesting in keeping active in LISP.

That would mean that(A+B) would turn into (PLUS A B) rather than (IPLUS A B), and (add X 3) would use PLUS, and (for I from 1 to 10 sum N) would use PLUS and GREATERP for the iteration, and PLUS for accumulating the sum.I believe that all of our microcodes including 4K DLion now implement PLUS for integers exactly as efficiently as IPLUS. I think IPLUS is anachronistic and has resulted in a number of bug reports and obscure confusions.There *is* a possibility that some odd piece of the system will stop working with this change, but I sort of doubt it.... the only difference is in the case where you do(for I from X to Y ...) and Y/X are floating point arguments.There is also a possibility that some odd case of PLUS/TIMES etc *doesn't* work the same or as fast, and that something will suddenly become dreadfully slower, but I also doubt it.Every other modern lisp defaults to generic arithmetic in lieu of other declarations. If you *SAY* explicitly IPLUS, you should of course get IPLUS, but if you don't say or say implicitly, this would change the default.A related proposal, but which would only affect our code and not users code, is tht I think we should compile the system so that "fetch" of datatype fields does a type check. Currently we don't. On the Dolphin and Dorado, the result was usually innocuous, but on DLions, it means that we get 9318's and other obscure behavior rather than errors. You can, of course, explicitly say "ffetch" rather than "fetch" if you want a Fast Fetch, but I think that for most of the system it doesn't matter (or it is doing a FFETCH anyway.) Both of these should go in before we do the global recompile of the system, of course.*start*00809 00024 US Date:  8 Aug 84 11:27 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: disappearing caret foundTo: LispCore^Reply-to: masinter.paI found and fixed a problem which was causing the caret to disappear: if you reshaped a window while the caret was up in a way to cause the caret to be outside of the clipping region, the system would believe the caret was "up", but would never take it "down" in order to reshow it in the new location. This sometimes happened when people had init files which reshaped the TTY window. It wasn't a problem when you invoked SHAPEW from the window menu, because popping up the window menu takes the caret down.In the course of fixing this, I also got rid of the 'CARET1' datatype, since it didn't really need to be a datatype at all and usually only had one instance.*start*00694 00024 US Date:  7 Aug 84 18:06 PDTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Re: proposal for incompatible default settings ....In-reply-to: MASINTER.PA's message of 6 AUG 84 22:32 PDTTo: MASINTER.PAcc: LispCore^.PAAlthough I think the changes that Larry is proposing are desirable things to do, I don't think this is the time to fool around with pervasive system declarations.

My problem is that I don't have enough room on my 29-MB disk for a separate Lisp volume, and so I plan to overwrite my 7900-page System (Star) volume with Lisp.sysout when needed, and then reinstall Star afterwards (installing the Star bootfile is trivial).  -- I just don't think this will work. Lisp should have more than 7900 pages for its virtual memory file, unless you run in SMALL.SYSOUT or what have you. If it were a 12000 page volume, this might work, but not 7900. I'll answer the questions anyway:1) When I reinstall Star, do I have to reinstall the Klamath diagnostic microcode too?-- only if you want to run diagnostics, of course.2) As for the compatibility of the Lisp initial microcode and the standard Klamath initial microcode, if I install the Lisp initial microcode, run Lisp, reinstall Star (and thus erase Lisp), and then do a 0-boot, will I end up in (a) Othello, or (b) some unpleasant state?-- I believe you may wind up in an unpleasant state, e.g., flashing 217 in the Maintenance Panel. I normally do 1-boots to start Star anyway. Alternatively, of course, you can load in new initial microcode.3) Are there any other cases where the two worlds may collide?-- yes, if you install Lisp on a volume that is small, it has a tendency to overrun the volume boundaries and trash the next volume. If you attempt to put Lisp on a 7900 page volume, you should make it the *last* volume.*start*00309 00024 US Date: 21 Aug 84 09:50 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Lisp: NIL - UNDEFINEDFUNCTION when CH.LIST.DOMAINS(*:XEROX)To: LispSupport.pacc: vanMelleLisp System Date: 21-Aug-84 06:58:35Machine: Dorado (Plaza)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 10000Frequency: OnceImpact: Moderate*start*00430 00024 US Date: 21 Aug 84 12:04 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: <lispcore>oncocin> files...In-reply-to: lichtenberg.wbst's message of 20 Aug 84 09:10:45 EDT (Monday)To: lichtenberg.wbst, Stansbury, Nuyens, LispSupportThe .STRIKE files on <LispCore>Oncocin> differ in length from the ones on <Lisp>Fonts> by the same name.

For European 1108s we map the control key to the shift lock position, but to interrupt truckin you still have to press the PROPS key.2) We hve had major problems saving players on NS file servers.  Although this looks like an Interlisp problem rather than LOOPS it does happen with much greater frequency in the LOOPS released sysout than any other (this is Fugue.6 version).  There are two hen making the first instace of some file containing the player a break sometimes occurs with "SPP retransmit queue out of order", this only happen occasionaly.  The second symtom is that when making subsequent versions a break occurs with "File wont Open", this happens nearly every time in the LOOPS world.  We have had more chance to look at this but cant get very far without sources.  As far as I can tell the fault is occuring when MAKEFILE is trying to read the previous version, it has found it OK and requested a stream on the file, courier passes back what looks like a valid stream handle.   However 	 somewhere along the line someone decides that the file doesnt have INPUT access although the ACCESSBITS is 1 (English is wonderful sometimes).

A filing connection still times out within a minute if Lisp is unresponsive, i.e., some process is not yielding and letting the SPP connection manager in.  However, when Lisp is responsive, even if it is not actively eating the data, the connection stays alive much longer.  In fact, I let one go for 25 minutes without it timing out, so it's possible there is no longer a Filing-level timeout at all during a transaction (which, after all, is what the spec requires).  So that's good news (assuming it used to not be true; I never did examine the old Services filing behavior in detail).But without preemptive process scheduling, we are still dead because of the responsiveness requirement.

Given that bias, I had a couple of observations:1.  When we stole your 'for' syntax (and implemented via a macro translation to Franz 'do') we allowed multiple 'in's.  Why is this illegal in Interlisp?  For example, how does one accomplish the following without two 'in's?     (for x in LIST1 y in LIST2 collect (CONS x y))(Our rule was that the for loop ends as soon as any 'in', 'out', 'from', etc. ends.)2.  Regarding 'if', why did you choose that syntax?  I've noticed that it makes it harder to type certain expressions that should be simple.  In particular, this applies to the ones with multiple 'then' or 'else' clauses since a PROGN is required.  Thus,    (COND (<booleanexpr> <expr1> <expr2>))requires    (if <booleanexpr> then (PROGN <expr1> <expr2>))which seems cumbersome so people will continue to use the simpler COND form.  We used an 'if' syntax that relied on the keywords 'then' and 'else' to dictate the breaks.  Specifically, the syntax is     <if-stmt> ::= (if <boolexpr> [<then-clause>][<else-clause>]    <then-clause> ::= [then] <forms>    <else-clause> ::= else <forms> | elseif <boolexpr>                                            [<then-clause>][<else-clause>]    <forms> ::= implicit PROGN of s-expressions.Since the 'then' keyword is optional, the above example could be written:    (if <booleanexpr> <expr1> <expr2>)which is quite compact.  There are other syntaxes for 'if' which allow multiple <booleanexpr>'s using an implicit AND.  In that case, the 'then' keyword is required.  But even that yields a more concise form then the Interlisp version.What's the reasoning here?- Randy*start*00538 00024 US Date: 30 Aug 84 13:27 PDTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: EOL Convention in TeditTo: Teditsupport, LispsupportI was under the impression that Tedit had been fixed to do the right kind of coercions for files whose EOL convention is not CR.This appears not to be the case.

Should SITENTRY appear twice as a local variable?  On AUg 20, when I executed this function on a Dlion, it broke inside $DEF (an NLAMBDA that evaluates its argument) with the message SITENTRY - Unbound atom.  Evidentally, it was picking up the wrong occurrance of SITENTRY on the stack.  Also on AUG20, execution of this function on a Dorado occasionally gave different results when interpreted than when compiled but I didn't have time to track them down.Today, the function seems to work on a DORADO, and I haven't tried it on a Dlion.--Tom  ï   

Interlisp can automatically convert files with different EOL conventions, but watch out with formatted TEDIT files: the formatting info at the end of the file contains absolute pointers, which can be invalidated if all CRs are converted to CRLF.  If you do a COPYFILE (which changes CRLF->CR) of the unformatted text, and then you use Tedit, you should be alright.In the latest versions of Interlisp, COPYFILE has been fixed to use the FTP protocol.  Until that version is released, you can use the following hack:(DEFINEQ (COPYFILE.FTP (A B)(PROG ((ASTREAM (OPENSTREAM A (QUOTE INPUT) (QUOTE OLD) NIL (QUOTE (SEQUENTIAL T)))) 	(BSTREAM (OPENSTREAM B (QUOTE OUTPUT) (QUOTE NEW) NIL (QUOTE (SEQUENTIAL T)))))	(COPYBYTES ASTREAM BSTREAM)	(CLOSEF ASTREAM)	(CLOSEF BSTREAM)))If you use COPYCHARS instead of COPYBYTES, this will also do the appropriate EOL conversion.*start*02435 00024 US Date: 30 Aug 84 19:26 PDTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: Lisp meeting 8/25To: Pahlavancc: Bird, Cheslow, Dering,  EDouglas, Hihn,  JFung, Le, Martin, Mersfelder, Spoor,  PYoung, Wogulis, Vittal, LispSupport.pa, Raim1.  Beau proclaimed that Dennis Dunn's sales force was "overwhelmed" with prospective customers.  2.  Rich Acuff plans to announce his DVI package, which allows hardcopy to go to "cheap" laser printers, such as the Imagen.  He continues to make progress on TCP/IP.3.  Richard Burton has implemented hardcopy streams, which allow the user to display text in the same form it will be printed (or a close approximation thereof).  This will be released as part of Richard's Sketch package.4.  Kelly announced the first release of a facility to archive local disk directories on floppies.  He also announced his fix to the Lisp/Mesa floppy incompatability problem.5. Mike Sannella released his Lisp based ARedit tool (to a well-deserved round of applause.)6.  Beau re-outlined the procedure for submitting urgent requests to PARC:  (1) Submit an AR plus a message to the person named in the Attention field of the AR.  (2) The PARC person who receives the AR must either take responsibility for it or re-assign responsibility to someone else.  (3) Mike Sannella  makes sure the assignment is made.  (4) If after a week no action has been taken, message Sheil.pa with a reference to the AR.7.  Ron Kaplan announced further enhancements to DIG.  Grapher has been enhanced to deliver clipped images to hardcopy.8.  Clay Agadoni and his organization were acknowledged for their responsiveness in getting a demo machine to Boston on very short notice.9.  Larry Masinter has made "countless" fixes to various major system components.  He released a new version of the Hello Mesa tool.10.  The customized sysout for APEX will be a Harmony sysout available by mid-November.11.  The current Harmony instabilities are: DLion file system, Tedit,  and printing.12.  Larry Masinter agreed to implement a "bucketizing" algorithm for allocating array space.13.  The question was raised whether unboxed floating point numbers should be supported in Harmony.  The observation was made that 1100 and 1132 performance would be adversely effected.  Steve Purcell suggested a DandeTiger library package which would provide unboxed floating point without affecting the performance of other machines.
