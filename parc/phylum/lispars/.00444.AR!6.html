Number: 444Date:  4-Apr-84  6':35':05Submitter: le.pasaSource: ERIC@SRI-KL.ARPASubject: Want "cumulative" mode for function call statsLisp Version: fugue.4Description: 'i once tried doing timings of function executions and i found that it'  would be  nice  to get  overlapping  time timings...   your  profiler'  functions count time in an  interesting way... if function foo  calls'  bar and bar calls baz,  any time spent in foo  that is also spent  in'  bar is given to bar (unless in baz, in which case it is attributed to'  baz).  the time is  attributed to the lowest  function that is  being'  timed.  that  is ok,  but it  would be  nice to  be able  to see  the'  figures done such that any time in foo was counted against foo; if in'  bar as well, then to  bar as well.  you see,  when you find out  that'  you are spending 20%  of your time in  assoc (or some such  function)'  you would like to know what functions are calling it so much...   see'  what i mean?  is there a way to do this? (2)Workaround: Look at the call information at the end of the stats to see who ASSOC is called by. It gives info on who calls ASSOC and how many times.Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 27-Jun-84 14':07':00Attn: Assigned To: MASINTERIn/By: Disposition: [marked Superceded, by SPY program]System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Performance ToolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: Impact: MinorPriority: Status: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
