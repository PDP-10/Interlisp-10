Then with "Delete-After" cause some humongous amount of code to be inserted after the "1-line" -- say about 50 lines or more.  Then DEdit can''t seem to scroll up enough to see the last part of the inserted stuff; not even after trying to select the whole thing and reprinting nor by "thumb" scrolling.''-----''Date': 17 Apr 84 14':09 PST'From': Dietterich.pa'Subject': Lisp': DEDIT Replace'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Dietterich.pa'Lisp-System-Date':  9-Apr-84 18':28':19'Machine-Type': Dorado''When I use the Dedit REPLACE command to replace small sections of text with much larger expressions, it often happens that the window will not scroll far enough to permit the new text to come entirely into view.  In my case, I am taking a skeletal definition for a function and replacing several different parts of it (that are initially NIL) with large expressions obtained from a second Dedit.  After doing the REPLACE operations, the Dedit window will scroll part of the way, but not enough to let me view the rest of the function.  No amount of reprinting or redisplaying works.  I have to leave Dedit and edit something else and then reedit the new function in order to clear the problem.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 17':52':15
