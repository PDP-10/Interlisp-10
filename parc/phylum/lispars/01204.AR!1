I find there are too many options in this form.  For instance, I forgot in the last one to fill out the Subject': field beacuse there were so many boxes to fill out.''Perhaps by default only some options are offered, and the form change depending on what you select as the problem area.''PS': Could the menus, and perhaps even the buttons have documentation?  What does "Design - Ul" mean?  The documentation should appear in the interaction window, not in PROMPTWINDOW.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 22-May-84 17':34':21Attn: SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: OtherMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
