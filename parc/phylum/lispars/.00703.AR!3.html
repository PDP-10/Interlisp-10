I''ve proposed a function TRUENAME which would initially do a LISTGET on the OTHERPROPS field of the stream (for a TRUENAME property), and failing that, would fetch any litatom found in the FULLFILENAME field.  Future extensions to the file ssytems we deal with may require a more interactive "name" finding mechanism -- in particular I''m thinking of file systems with indirect aliasing.''mjs 4/13/84 -- also, see AR 41 (the infamous FULLNAME discussion)]Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date: 20-Apr-84 14':01':11Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: IncompleteProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
