This is not critical for CSLI at this time --- and the changes Greg has been working on should us to simply send a file to the NS printer a la EMPRESS.   However, CSLI (and other sites with NS printers) are going to need the necessary pieces eventually.  My questions are':''1) what files are needed to support NS printers with Tedit,''2) where can these files reside (e.g., NS file server, local disk, floppy, memory, alien file server, IFS),''3) what will be the mechanism by which these files and all necessary supporting documentation are distributed, and who will be responsible for this task?'''---Jim'   ''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: sybalsky, kaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
