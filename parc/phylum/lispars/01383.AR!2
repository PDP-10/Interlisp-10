I never again got into the situation where it hung as I showed you, but I did several more times try to move text from one tedit to the other while a Put was going on.  It worked once; the other 7 times, once the Put finished, it said "Please select a destination for the copy first" and unhighlighted the source.  Caret was flashing in the intended destination at the time.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalskyEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 16':54':43
