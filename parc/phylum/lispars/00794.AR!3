But this is exactly where it is needed most, since if the button event causes a change in the objects dimensions or its display, TEDIT should redisplay it.''Under these circumstances TEDIT.OBJECT.CHANGED seems to call the objects ImageBox Fn okay.  And in fact changes TEDIT notion of the object''s size.  But it never calls the obkects DISPLAYFN and never repaints the object.  And it also never reformats the text around the object if the object changes size.'''Frank''[JDS, IN DECLINING':  Within the BUTTONEVENTINFN, the window''s clipping region is restricted to the object''s image area, to prevent spurious over-writes and simplify lots of code, and besides because the spec says so.  Hence, there''s no way TEDIT.OBJECT.CHANGED can do what you want.  The correct course is for your BUTTONEVENTINFN to return the atom CHANGED (I think--check the updated spec), whereupon TEdit will update the screen]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 20-Jul-84 09':56':48
