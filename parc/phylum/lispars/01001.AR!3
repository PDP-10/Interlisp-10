Raid said "compiler/microcode error': unknown UFN."  The stack looked like this': (forgive my punctuation/spelling)''	raid'	\mp.error'	\unknown.ufn'	\sysbufp'	\waitforsysbufp'	errorset'	errorset'	\tedit.command.loop'	\tedit2'	\evalform'	errorset'	\make.process0'	T''The sysout was that of 2-May-84 00':11':18; Susi was browsing mail when it happened.  I eventually ^N-ed back into Lisp and looked at the code of \SYSBUFP, which looked ok to my untrained eye.  Everything ran fine after that, and Susi was able to continue browsing.''Blame it on cosmic rays.'		Herb'''Date': 10 May 84 11':02 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''On the evidence presented in the report, I have reclassified this from Tedit to Dolphin microcode, priority unlikely.  I.e., it looks like either the microcode took a wild leap in \SYSBUFP (not likely), it returned to the wrong place from a function call (also unlikely), or there is a bug in the stack code (Lisp or microcode), and the \SYSBUFP frame had just undergone a stack overflow or hard return (conceivable).''Without a much more detailed examination of the stack, there isn''t enough to go on.  The one piece of evidence that I would have loved to have seen in the report was the pc of \SYSBUFP.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date:  5-Sep-84 17':31':51
