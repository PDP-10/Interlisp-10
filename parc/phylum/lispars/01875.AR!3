Try the following':''Type in a line or two of text.  Using the extended menu select ALL and change it to Times Roman.  Put a break-point on FONTCREATE and do a hardcopy to an Interpress printer.  After `creating'' a few Times Roman fonts FONTCREATE will be called (from FONTCOPY from TEDIT.IP.HARDCOPY) to produce an Interpress version of a Gacha 10 MRR display font.''Perhaps the GACHA is hardcoded - title or soemthing.  If so, could it be changed to something like Classic?''Although fairly harmless in itself, I am worried that we will get a lot of customers reporting that the Interpress/Font "fix" doesn''t work.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 11':17':26
