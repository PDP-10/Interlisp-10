We then loaded some packages into the sysout. Next, we initialised the local filing volume by doing a MKDIR. Next, we did a sysout to the file server. When we reloaded the sysout, it appeared that the local filing volume was now empty. If we reloaded the supplied sysout, then the local filing volume appeared correct. Is there a function to make Interlisp-D reset what it thinks about file devices and redo the volume search/creation of core device if there isn''t one?''-----------------------------------------------------''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 17':31':17
