If I''d wanted that behaviour, I''d have said'DIR FOO*;6 DELETE''''Date':  8 MAR 84 19':16 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': Re': DIR FOO;6 DELETE'To':   JONL, LispSupport''In response to the message sent   8 MAR 84 18':36 PST from JONL.PA''Ahhh, I see now a "consistent" reading of the documentation on the DIR'p.a. command which explains this behaviour':  "... * and * as the default'extension and default version respectively".''Even though this is modeled after the TENEX DIR command, I''d much prefer 'that NO default extension be supplied.   I.e., I like the model of the "List" 'command on IFS''s better.'''Since the question came up in the context of a DELETE, it might'be worth asking if some re-constituted DEL command could be devised; in'particular, it would supply no "defaults" for extensions, versions etc.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 13-Apr-84 15':09':07Attn: jellinekAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
