Consider the following scenario':  Makefile to a floppy.  Copy the file to a fileserver.  Logout.  Next day edit the file on the fileserver.  Do a makefile back to the fileserver,.  Interlisp will break, trying to locate the file on a floppy, which probably is no longer loaded.  This usually happens to people who never knew the file originated from a floppy!'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':31':37</pre>
