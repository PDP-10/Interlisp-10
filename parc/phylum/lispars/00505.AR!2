Perhaps another AR needs to be generated "Please document'RS232LOGIN".  ''P.S.  RS232LOGIN currently seems to be broken, and I''ve lent my MODEM'   out to someone (who? not sure, maybe Halverson), so I''ll have to get'   it fixed before wanting others to read the documentation.  It got'   broken once last fall when Bill changed the contents of'   the data in LOGINPASSWORDS (he flubbed an edit trying to update RS232LOGIN),'   but the particular problem now sseems to be deeper.''-----''Date': 13 MAR 84 23':49 PST'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': auto login sequences for Chat/RS232'To':   LISPSUPPORT''My TRS-80 100 lap computer has a feature which is probably necessary for generic auto-login sequences.
