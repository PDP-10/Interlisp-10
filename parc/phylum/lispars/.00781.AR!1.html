Number: 781Date: 20-Apr-84 13':15':14Submitter: Masinter.PASource: Masinter.pa (From Schlumberger)Subject: Want BITBLTSETUP so users can call PILOTBITBLT directlyLisp Version: Description: Schlumberger (and a number of other users) have requirements for high performance display operations. The user callable BITBLT primitive just has too much overhead. When a visitor from Schlumberger was here, we (Purcell and Masinter) created a primitive called BITBLTSETUP, which did all of the clipping that BITBLT did, but then merely returned a (new) PILOTBITBLTTABLE. The user then could make modifications to the table, and call PILOTBITBLT directly.''This is important to ''expose the performance of the machine''. A number of other people out there want to use the machine for animation, etc.''This seems like a relatively safe way of letting people have access to performance. Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: JonL, BurtonAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: Priority: HopefullyStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: LLDISPLAY</pre>
