You get the error message ILLEGAL STACK ARG NIL twice whenever you type a u.b.a. or a CLISP expression.  The documentation on page 8.28 (section 8.7) states "A user can call LISPX specifying any propt character as LISPXID except for *, since in certain cases LISPX must use the value of LISPXID to tell whether or not it was called from the editor."  This should be amended to say "except for * and ':, since  ..." "...called from the editor or the break package."''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 18':45':16Attn: DocumentationAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: DWIMMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
