The characters that are printed out by IPBOUTCHARCODE are measured as they go by, which isn''t so cool if you are printing out the charset shift, the new charset number, etc. in this way.''Seems like here, and perhaps other places, we have to measure the width of the original 16 bit code (how do we do that?) before we print it out.''This might not matter in MAKEINTERPRESS, but INTERPRESS.OUTCHARFN and perhaps IP.PRIN3 really do care about this.''--Ron''-----''Date': 21 Mar 84 09':35 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': Incorrect fontwidths for special Interpress codes'In-reply-to': Kaplan.pa''s message of 20 Mar 84 23':28 PST'To': Kaplan.pa'cc': Lispsupport.pa, Sybalsky.pa''In the short run, we shouldn''t have much trouble with the fonts widths inconsistency.   The reason is that the screen Star fonts--and the NSFonts widths files--all obey the STAR character code set instead of the NS code set.  Thus, hyphen and dollar sign have the right width.''Until we get real NS support, I have no good schemes for how to handle the problem in general; perhaps we should just create our own version of the star build-a-font-file tool to do the conversions.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sybalsky, KaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
