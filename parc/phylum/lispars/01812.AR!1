Right now, BKSYSBUF sticks the characters into the input buffer of whoever has the TTY.''Of course, I bet there are *other* programs which expect the *current* behavior. So, maybe this is some kind of dilemma.''-----''Date': 19 Jul 84 17':12 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': BKSYSBUF sends chars to wrong process'In-reply-to': MASINTER.PA''s message of 19 JUL 84 15':58 PDT'To': MASINTER.PA'cc': LispSupport.PA, vanMelle.PA''You can''t have it both ways.  I think the current behavior is correct (as the manual says, "The effect is the same as though the user typed x.").  It certainly is correct for that favorite use of BKSYSBUF, Copy-select.''It is conceivable that we want to extend BKSYSBUF with an optional process arg.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
