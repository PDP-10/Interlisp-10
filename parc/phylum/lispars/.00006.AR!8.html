Number: 6Date: 16-Mar-84 23':49':52Submitter: Sannella.paSource: Shulman@rutgersSubject: pretty doesn''t use CLISPWORD uniformly for CLISPFONT controlLisp Version: Fugue.5Description: 'Received': from RUTGERS.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA; 12 MAR 84 12':52':05 PST'Date': 12 Mar 84 14':14':56 EST'From': Jeffrey Shulman &lt;SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA&gt;'Subject': CLISPFONT and CLISPWORDs'To': lispsupport.pa'cc': SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA'''	Under the documentation for CLISPFONT (p 6.55) it says that this'is the font for printing clisp words "i.e. atoms with property CLISPWORD."'This might lead one to believe that any item with this property would be'printed in the CLISPFONT.  The situation was this':  I needed to augment'the record package to include something of the form':''(make &lt;newitem&gt; memberof &lt;path&gt; of &lt;object&gt;)''which would translate to':''(OR (MEMBER &lt;newitem&gt; (fetch &lt;path&gt; of &lt;object&gt;))'    (replace &lt;path&gt; of &lt;object&gt; with '     (CONS &lt;newitem&gt; (fetch &lt;path&gt; of &lt;object&gt;))))''So I then wrote a "tran" function and placed this function on the'CLISPWORD property of MAKE, make, MEMBEROF and memberof.  "OF" and'"of" already had RECORDTRAN on the CLISPWORD property so I left it'(the doc on CLISPWORD (p 16.22) did not say it could be a list.)''Now, when a function containing my "make" form was prettyprinted both'the words "make" and "memberof" were boldface (the CLISPFONT) but the'word "of" was in plain text.  To make a long story short, it turns out'that in order for prettyprint to print CLISPWORDs in the CLISPFONT each'word must have the same "tran" function on the CLISPWORD property.''I don''t know whether to call this a bug or a "feature."''							Jeff''P.S. I solved my problem by making "make" and "memberof" both'RECORDTRAN CLISPWORDs (like "of") and ADVISING RECORDTRAN to use'my "tran" if it sees the "make" keyword.'-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 19-Mar-84 12':11':21Attn: Kaplan.PAAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm minor edit]System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: PRETTY</pre>
