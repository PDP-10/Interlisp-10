I now see that this is the case both with the version on &lt;lispcore&gt;next&gt; and &lt;lisp&gt;current&gt;. I am also now in a state where remote boot always fails.  I believe that the cause of my problem may have to do with the untraditional names I assigned my volumes (Tajo, System, Semantics, Phonology, Bootlisp and DSK).  When the tool comes up there is a message "Volume not found!" .  Why?  I haven''t told it to go looking for any volume in particular.''-----''Date':  9 May 84 10':24':09 PDT (Wednesday)'From': JFung.pasa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Installlisptool bombs on remote boot'In-reply-to': halvorsen.pa''s message of 8 May 84 18':17 PDT'To': halvorsen.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa, Jfung''Kris,''I dont think the way the disk is configured has anything to do with this problem.  The message "Volume not found!" is posted because the code does a default setting of "lisp" volume on your volume menu.  I''ll make the message more meaningful.''I will continue to test this, if I cannot diagnose the situation in couple days (since I was not able to repeat what you told me), I''ll sumbit an AR.

I do think what you name the volumes has a lot to do with whether Remote boot succeeds or fails in the way I described.  Last night I reconfigured my machine from having the volumes Tajo, Phonology, Semantics, DSK  and BootLisp to having Tajo, Lisp, Lisp2, Lisp3 and DSK.  I now have no problems using remote boot.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: JFung.pasaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
