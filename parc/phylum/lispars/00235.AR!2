Since the compiler doesn''t block, this is a problem we won''t really experience until we have a preemtive scheduler.  By the time we have a preemtive scheduler, I would think that ideally we should restructure the compiler so that it does not depend upon global state, but a shorter-term solution might be to monitor-lock the global state the compiler uses, so that different instances wait for each other instead of jumping all over each other.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 17':34':22
