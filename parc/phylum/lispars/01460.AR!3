DIR {DSK} shows FOO.'Logout and get into Lisp2 partition (one that has already been used and recognizes {DSK} as the local disk.) Do a DIR {DSK} and FOO does not show up. 'If you then install a new sysout on Lisp2, and do DIR {DSK} FOO will show up.'Also doing a DELFILE from Lisp1 of a file that both partitions recognize, and then try to see that file from Lisp2, you get a break with shouldn''t happen "Key not found".'Each different Lisp has its own idea of what should be on {DSK} when they sould really be consistent with each other.''System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
