I think the Frequency must be Intermittent since "reallocating" has worked in the past.  I''ll have to set up some code that specifically exercises the "reallocating" part of FLOPPY to find where the problem lies.  This may take a while so I''ve marked Difficulty Hard.]'[KBR 22-AUG-84': No one other than this person has complained--the problem can''t be that urgent.  PRIORITY _ HOPEFULLY instead of ABSOLUTELY] ' Description: 'We are having a problem when our 1108''s try to "reallocate" a floppy'during (for instance) MAKEFILE.  I conjecture that a pointer to the'old file is kept around across the compaction because if the file being'made is new, there is no problem, but if, for instance, a recompile is'being done, there is grave lossage in the new file.''   Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: RoachEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 20':29':30
