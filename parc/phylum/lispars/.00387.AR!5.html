Number: 387Date: 29-Mar-84 14':09':55Submitter: Sannella.paSource: Feuerman.pasaSubject: paragraph start, stop info lost ?Lisp Version: 25-feb-84Description: Date': Wed, 28 Mar 84 09':40 PST'From': Feuerman.pasa'Subject': TEdit Bug(?)'To': TEditSupport.pa'cc': , Feuerman''It''s a little complicated, but I think the problem is that the information about paragraph starts and stops isn''t making its way onto a file.''I''ve changed TEDIT.DEFAULT.FMTSPEC so that the 1STLEFTMAR is at 0, and LEFTMAR is at 64 (or so).  Basically, it looks like reverse indentation.  I put some text out there, and I call TEDIT.PUT.PCTB on the TEXTOBJ of the text.  Then I do (SETQ STREAM (OPENTEXTSTREAM Filename NIL Start End)), where I do know for certain the starts and stops of the text stream.  This time, however, when I call (TEDIT STREAM), only the first line is flushed left to 0, and all other lines start at 64 (including the starts of subsequent paragraphs).  I INSPECTed my way through the piece table of STREAM, and found (in addition to the fact that it has shrunk after going through the file) that the PPARALAST field of each of the pieces was set to NIL, whereas before these fields correctly indicated the ends of the paragraphs.''I''m not sure if this has already been fixed, but I''m running from a Carol full.sysout on Rosebowl dated 25-Feb-84 17':29':22 on a Dandelion.  What is the procedure on fixing these things?  When and how do I find out if this has been fixed?  Thanks for the help.''--Ken.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 18':52':25Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
