On the other hand, if I call \GETKEY and there ARE characters waiting, I don''t get the window.''I''m starting to have customers of TEdit who want to read their own characters and do their own echoing--and who don''t understand why this  extra window keeps appearing.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':56':00Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: This seems not to happen in recent loadups.
