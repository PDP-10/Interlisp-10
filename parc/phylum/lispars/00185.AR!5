It displays the user''s name, the Etherhostname (or the octal net address when no nameserver is available) and the user''s idle time (time since last keystroke or mouseaction).  Only other users who have the finger server loaded will be displayed.  Users can specify the net radius to query, a list specifying only which users they want displayed, or similarly, only which hosts are to be displayed.'''Finger is stored on {phylum}<lispusers>finger.dcom.'Documentation is {phylum}<lispusers>finger.tedit.''As always, comments and suggestions welcomed.''Greg''-----''Date': 21 Mar 84 17':30 PST'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': release of LispUsers package FINGER'In-reply-to': Nuyens.pa''s message of 18 Mar 84 19':00 PST'To': Nuyens.pa'cc': LispUsers^.pa''are you sure that your Finger program doesn''t polute the net?''Also, I couldn''t get it to print anything on a DLion, have you been able to get it to print something?''-----''Date': 22 Mar 84 11':44 PST'From': halvorsen.pa'Subject': Re': release of LispUsers package FINGER'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 21 Mar 84 17':30 PST'To': Masinter.pa'cc': Nuyens.pa, LispUsers^.pa''I get it to print on a Dlion, but as I mentioned to Greg, updates sometimes give unexpected results (users fall out and reappear).''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 28-Mar-84 12':20':53Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: Nuyens.paIn/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: AbsolutelyStatus: FixedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
