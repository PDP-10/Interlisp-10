It appeared this way both on the display and on the hardcopy (about 5.5" on the hardcopy).  Furthermore, every subsequent call to Tedit had tabs behaving this way; if I do a paragraph Show on an otherwise unformatted document, it fills in Default Tab Size': 60 and one Left Tab set at 35.''By the way, in some earlier editing of another document, I had set a Left Tab at 35.''Mimi'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 28-Mar-84  9':19':08Attn: Assigned To: In/By: AR 44Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: OnceImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: SupersededProblem Type: BugSource Files:
