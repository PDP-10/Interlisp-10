If you want to be able to issue editing commands to TTYIN during your typein, you should either call (TTYINMETA T) to enable bottom-blank (STOP on 1108''s) as a true meta key, or set EDITPREFIXCHAR to the character code of your preferred meta prefix (it used to be 193, for top-blank).'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 17':32':57
