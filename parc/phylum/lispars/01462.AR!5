I''ve'    received it any time I try to load a file off a floppy after'    doing a sysout from that partition.  By doing a sysout, I mean'    either saving the current state of virtual memory as a sysout'    file, or copying a sysout from floppies to some other file'    (in my case, on our VAX).  After this, trying to access files'    on floppies results in the above error message.  For some'    reason \OPENFILE calls \SFLOPPY.OPENHUGEFILE before the error.'    I can tell you all the files currently loaded if that helps.'    An answer on how to fix this would be appreciated, since I'    would rather not have to contend with this.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date:  4-Sep-84 14':13':34
