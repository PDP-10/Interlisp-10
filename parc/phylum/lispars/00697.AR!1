Mousing the main Dedit window didn''t bring the command menu up; and depending on the "tenacity" of the window now occluding the command menu, I found that even ^E didn''t always bring it to top (TEdit windows seem to be more "tenacious" in this regard than  "regular" TtyDisplayStreams).''A similar problem occurs when you re-enter DEdit by mousing a secondary window of the process running the DEdit (e.g., the Exec window when you have entered DEdit normally, but exited it by mousing some other process''s ttywindow) -- keyboard typein now goes into the DEdit input buffer, which comes to top, but the main window (and also the menu window) don''t come up.''-----''Date': 12 Apr 84 14':22 PST'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Buried DEdit command menu "disappears"'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 11 Apr 84 19':06 PST'To': JonL.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa''DEdit no longer forces its menu to the top continually - scads of people had complained about this. Perhaps mousing the main window should (perhaps) get the menu to the top. However, there is an easier way - the TAB key pulls the menu up (and over) whenever it is active. Use that.''Beau''-----''Date': 12 Apr 84 18':16 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Buried DEdit command menu "disappears"'In-reply-to': Sheil.pa''s message of 12 Apr 84 14':22 PST'To': Sheil.pa'cc': JonL.pa, LispSupport.pa''There are two problems here':''1) not having the semi-attached DEdit command window come to top when the main window is brought up is a very troublesome discontinuity in the windowworld interface;''2) although the TAB key brings up the command menu, when it is active,  the problem is determining just *** who is active ***; that is pressing TAB is not necessarily a safe determiner of state (because in the "other" state, you can have a process waiting for keyboard confirmation).  I''d consider Mousing the command menu a "safe" determiner; the problem is to find the menu.' 'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sheil.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
