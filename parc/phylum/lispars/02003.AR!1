However, there is a non-trivial amount of work to do to isolate the displaystream dependent parts of code and prevent them from going into a non-Interlisp-D version.  I''ll forward you request to the LispCore group here for commentary, but we really aren''t very much in the business of supporting Interlisp-10 now.''-- JonL White --''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
