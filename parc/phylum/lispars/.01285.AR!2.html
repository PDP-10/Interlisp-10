Number: 1285Date:  1-Jun-84 12':10':51Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Jeffrey Shulman &lt;SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA&gt;Subject: New package': RECORDERLisp Version: Description: 'Return-Path': SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA'Received': from RUTGERS.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 13 MAY 84 10':36':17 PDT'Date': 13 May 84 13':35':24 EDT'From': Jeffrey Shulman &lt;SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA&gt;'Subject': New RECORDER'To': masinter.pa'cc': burton.pa, lispsupport.pa, raim.pasa, SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA'''	Following the advice and Larry and JonL I seem to be getting somewhere.'I can now reliably record the mouse under a new GETMOUSESTATE (I am working'on recording the keyboard now.)'	There is still one more problem':  Under my new \KEYHANDLER1 the mouse'freezes when it goes to the edges of the screen on my DLion.  I have tracked'this down to that "repeatuntil" loop in the \SETMOUSEXY macro.  Could I be'using an outdated version of LLKEY (mine is LLKEY.':120 dated 1/8/84)?  I am'also using a fairly old EXPORTS.ALL (I am actually using a small subset'which I put a copy of on [MAXC]&lt;1100USERS&gt;EXPORTS.LLKEY) which might also'cause problems.'	Looking on [MAXC]&lt;BLISP&gt; I noticed that LLKEY is now up around version'148.  Could I be given access to &lt;BLISP&gt;? (I *was* able to read files on it'at one time but not any longer.)  I have signed a non-disclosure agreement as'part of my consulting contract.''							Jeff''P.S.  I''ll place an alpha copy of the new RECORDER on &lt;1100USERS&gt; as soon as'I get key handling working.'-------''Return-Path': &lt;SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA&gt;'Received': from RUTGERS.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 21 MAY 84 10':13':38 PDT'Date': 20 May 84 18':24':06 EDT'From': Jeffrey Shulman &lt;SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA&gt;'Subject': RECORDER'To': raim.pasa, lispsupport.pa'cc': SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA'''	I just deposited a priliminary version of RECORDER and documentation'on [MAXC]&lt;1100USERS&gt;.  Please give a look and let me know what you think.'It still seems to freeze my DLion for no known (to me) reason on seemingly'random occasions.'	This version lacks handling of "shift" keys which I will get to'next weekend.''								Jeff''P.S.
