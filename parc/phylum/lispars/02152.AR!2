But the message printed out during this phase simply says something like'"loading from file {ERIS}<USER>ALLMY.DATA"'Espeically during calls from the functional interface to the TTY EDITOR, it would be nice if it could say'"loading SOMEFN from file {ERIS}<USER>ALLMY.DATA"'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':08':09
