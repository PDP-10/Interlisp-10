CLISPIFY *correctly* leaves the CAR expression unchanged as Y might eventually be an NLAMBDA.''Consider now (LAMBDA NIL (X Y ': 1] where X is an undefined function.  DWIMIFY *should* leave the "':" expression alone for the same reason, but doesn''t.''(Both handle existing NLAMBDAs correctly).'----------''Date': 15 Aug 84 14':41':21 PDT (Wednesday)'From': masinter.PA'Subject': Re': AR-Submit'In-reply-to': Bird.pasa''s message of 15 Aug 84 14':19 PDT'To': Bird.pasa'cc': Le.pasa, 1100Support, LispSupport''I''m not sure this is a non-feature... for example, if NLAMA/NLAML contain (X), DWIMIFY will leave (X Y ': 1) alone. ''The system currently assumes all functions are lambda-spreads unless told otherwise. I could turn that assumption off, but there are a number of cases where it is the ''right'' thing to do.
