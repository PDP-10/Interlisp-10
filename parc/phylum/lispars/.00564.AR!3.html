If there is'a way for me to use the AR system from a dumb terminal, let me know.)''Contrary to p. 2.38 of the Interlisp manual, the variables'MIN.SMALLP, MAX.SMALLP, MIN.FIXP, and MAX.FIXP are not bound in'Interlisp-10.  MIN.INTEGER and MAX.INTEGER are bound to reasonable values.''-----''From': lispar.auto'Date':  8-Apr-84 18':04':22 PST'Subject': Re': MIN/MAX.SMALLP/FIXP not bound in Interlisp-10'In-reply-to': DEUTSCH.PA''s message of 8 APR 84 11':33 PST'To': DEUTSCH.PA'cc': LispSupport.PA, Masinter.PA, JonL.PA''Peter,''First, it is always appropriate to just send messages to LispSupport. ''Apparently the Interlisp-10 versions of these constants got dropped somewhere along the line. I seem to recall that they had been set up at one time. Will look into it further.

As it stands now, FIXP as a predicate is a union of types, and'should Interlisp elect to take the MacLisp route, then FIXP would also be'true of bignums.  In any case, MiIN/MAX.INTEGER is superfluous, and although'I suggested de-documenting it, it is lurking around to further confuse'the bignum-extension issue.''I don''t know what file would be appropriate for setting these values'in Interlisp-10, but it''s certainly likely that no one here is likely to'massage I-10 for efficient, integrated bignums.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 30-Jun-84 01':04':05</pre>
