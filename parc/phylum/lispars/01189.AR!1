''Actually, I''m not concerned about all the possible exceptions -- like "index" -> "indices", "cherub" -> "cherubim", "sheep" -> "sheep", "child" -> "children" -- but just enough to make the filepkg slightly smarter.  It will take a possible filepkgcom -- say, RESOURCE -- and recognize it as RESOURCES.  "index" -> "indexes" would be quite all right, but "index" -> "indexs" of course wouldn''t.''Either of you got any ideas?''ALso, when typing out messages, I often want to say "doing the foo action for the n''th time" where N ranges over all integers.  So I''d like to correctly say "the 23''rd time" and "the 30''th time" and "the 101''st time".  I think the tiny little function ORDINALSUFFIXSTRING.ES in <LISP>LIBRARY>EVALSERVER accomplishes this, and suggest it for inclusion in the system.  Any comments on this one too?''-- JonL --''-----''Date': 17 May 84 09':06 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': Making plurals and ordinals 'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 17 May 84 00':14 PST'To': JonL.pa'cc': Kaplan.pa, Kay.pa, Sannella.pa, Lispsupport.pa''sounds like a good LispUsers package....
