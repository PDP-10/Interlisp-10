Phil'Young should be able to copy the tape and send to 1100 customers that'request it.  Questions, comments, any enhancements, and bug reports'should be sent to me.''The 4.2 PUP software is much improved over the 4.1 release.  It'supports DEC DEUNA, 3Com,  and InterLan standard Ethernet controllers,'and Xerox Experimental Ethernet (3Mbit/second) controllers in any'combination.  You can even use your Vax as a PUP gateway between'Ethernets, or as a protocol converting gateway to the Arpa Internet,'since IP/TCP packets can be sent over the same interfaces.''Included are necessary kernel drivers, a PUP library, user and server'Telnet, user and server FTP (that now works to boot Lisp SYSOUTs to'Dandelions), user and server Mail, and user and server Leaf (for remote'file access).  Since 4.2 supports arbitrarily long filenames, versions'are simulated with a trailing printable character string, compatible'with InterLisp-Vax. Documentation includes Unix manual pages,'an installation document, and a Leaf server document.  ''The software currently runs only on DEC VAXes, but there has been some'interest in porting it to the SUN or Pyramid implementations of 4.2'Unix.  Please send me a message if this interests you, especially if'you are willing to help.''	-- Bill''-----''Date': Fri, 11 May 84 16':30 PDT'From': PYoung.pasa'Subject': Re': HOLD 4.2 Unix PUP software'In-reply-to': "nowicki@PESCADERO.ARPA''s message of Mon, 7 May 84 18':34':15 pdt"'To': 1100Users@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA'cc': Bill Nowicki <nowicki@PESCADERO.ARPA>, 1100Support, LispSupport.PA''The purpose of this message is to announce that I have placed a hold on the 4.2 Unix PUP software distribution. I apologize for the frustrated expectations this this decision is bound to cause, judging from the number of requests for the software I recieved in just one day.''It is true that I volunteered to distribute the tapes and documentation and to send out the release announcement. Unfortunately I was denied the latter privilege.''I had planned to review the documentation and send the software out to a few beta sites to see whether it would survive in a non-Stanford networking environment, that is, one that does not contain gateways and other machines performing network services. I still believe that this is the correct way to proceed.''So please continue to send in requests to me but wait for my announcement about a specific date for the availability of the software.''Phil Young   ''-----''Date': Mon, 14 May 84 11':38 PDT'From': Raim.pasa'Subject': Re': HOLD 4.2 Unix PUP software'In-reply-to': "Halasz.pa''s message of 12 May 84 00':04 PST"'To': Halasz.pa'cc': PYoung, 1100Support, LispSupport.pa''"Your message is totally incomprehensible and non-informative.  Exactly what is it that is holding up the 4.2 PUP software release????"''Frank,''I comprehended Phil''s message.  I derived useful information from it.  ''The information I gleaned from it is as follows':  ''1.  Phil wants to make sure the PUP software works outside of Stanford.  (Initially, I''m sure it WON''T at most 4.2 sites.)''2.  Phil prefers  to announce this software  to our customers WHEN it works outside of Stanford.''3.  Phil prefered that Stanford NOT announce the availability of this software to his 1108/1100 customers until he had established that it worked outside of Stanford.  Like it or not, he takes the hit when the our machines don''t interact sucessfully with the Stanford software.''Rather than attacking the information content of Phil''s note in public, you could have sent a civilized request for clarification.''--Marty''''''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: PYoung.pasaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
