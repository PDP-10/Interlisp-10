Resolution': warn users strongly in manual, (ZEROP 0.0) = NIL, and that they should probably use (EQP x 0) if they care.]' 'Subject': ZEROP'From': GREENFELD@BBNG.ARPA'To': LispSupport.pa''Don''t you people think its time to change the abomination called ZEROP?  If for no other reason than internal consistency of Interlisp, I suggest that you redefine ZEROP to be (EQP x 0) and define a new function IZEROP to be what the old ZEROP did.  While this is a change to an existing function (and therefore not to be done lightly) I believe more people have been bitten by this function than have counted on its strange behavior.''Norton'-----''Date':  2 APR 84 14':55 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': AR 317': ZEROP should be redefined''...'Using the masterscope database for the system code (as well as many library packages) I could easily "fix up" any system usages for which this change would cause problems.  Also, I believe an OPENLAMBDA macro  definition for the new ZEROP, which would do a SELECTC on (NTYPX X) first (begfore doing a function call) would forstall any time-performance problems.'''From': Masinter'Need to worry about NEGATE, and CLISPIFY and DWIMIFY.'(lmm': I think these have now been taken care of.)'''From': JonL'Date': 23-Sep-84'I''ve ben converting instances of ZEROP found in critical, or semi-critical, pieces of system code into usages of (EQ 0 ...), so that as-and-when this change goes through, these places won''t be affected by the extra bytecodes needed to effect genericity.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JonL.paEdit-Date: 23-Sep-84 21':00':10</pre>
