These were actually two somewhat unrelated problems.  The first, that *''s don''t work right sometimes, I had never observed, and the failure examples you gave all work the way they''re supposed to.  I suppose that I must have inadvertently fixed whatever problem there was there in my rework of unsorted directory enumeration in July.  The second problem, that of \SEARCHDIR1, I fixed before the Carol release.  The problem there was that I depended on parts of mod44io which were changing.  I think I have removed all dependencies on mod44io.  -- Tayloe.'["stansbury" " 5-Sep-84 19':28':31" Assigned% To': Attn': Status':(Open-&gt;Fixed) Disposition':]Description: 'Date': 15 Jun 84 02':18 PDT'From': Halasz.pa'Subject': Lisp': FILDIR, DIR, etc do not work correctly on the DLion local disk'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Halasz.pa''Lisp System Date':  8-Jun-84 14':02':40'Machine': DandeLion (Halasz)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': Always'Impact': Serious''FILDIR and its cousins do not work correctly on the DLion local disk.  I''m not sure how to characterize their behavior, execept to say that FILDIR often does not find files that are actually there.
