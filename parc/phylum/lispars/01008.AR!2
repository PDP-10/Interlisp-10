'We could actually base a ''lesson'' on advanced Interlisp-D programming by giving'people excersizes based on the sample problem -- take latticer and make some 'changes to it.''I think all that needs to be done is to take CINDY out and document it''The demo sysout is also screwed up in a couple of ways -- the fonts don''t 'really look good, hardcopy from it is odd, and the file package is confused 'because it doesn''t know about the file latticer. It should probably put 'latticer as a source file on {DISK} or some other core device.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  8-May-84 10':10':45Attn: Stansbury, SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: MinorPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
