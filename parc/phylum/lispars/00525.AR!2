However, Ron Kaplan tells me that this is not the case over at CSLI --- when he CHATed to CSLI-TURING (a 2060) and started EMACS, he was asked to specify what kind of terminal he was on.  How can this be rectified?  I could not find anything in the book on this (or on CHAT''s EMACS mode).''---Jim ''-----''Date':  4 Apr 84 14':42 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': CHAT to DEC20s'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 4 Apr 84 12':53':06 PST (Wednesday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa''It is either a problem in the setting of the global CHAT.DISPLAYTYPE (the numeric code of "Datamedia" on the host being chatted to), or the host''s chat server does not recognize the displaytype mark byte.''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 13':05 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': more Ar''s'To': LispSupport'cc': vanMelle.pa''Ar 525': This is either fixed or declined (the fix being to set CHAT.DISPLAYTYPE correctly).
