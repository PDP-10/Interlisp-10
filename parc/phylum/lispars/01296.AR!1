I think we should probably set the protection so that World can Submit, but only LispCore^ and 1100Support can Edit. I think this can be done merely by setting protections on Phylum, but I''m not 100% sure.''Larry''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
