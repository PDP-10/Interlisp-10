Could the code that traps the error check to see if the error was due to user ^E or (ERROR!) caused by invalid filemap??'richard''-----''Date': 21 Mar 84 11':07 PST'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Lisp': Addendum to filemap making'To': LispSupport.pa'Lisp-System-Date': 15-Mar-84 00':13':18'Machine-Type': Dorado''When I did a MAKEFILE on the file that had had its file map rewritten, the system rewrote it again.''richard''-----''Date': 22 Mar 84 10':48 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': AR 250': Filemap rewrite code should check error type'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 22 Mar 84 10':28':32 PST (Thursday)'To': LispSupport.pa''I''m not a filemap expert.
