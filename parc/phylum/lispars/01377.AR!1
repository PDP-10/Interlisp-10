This is a completely useless behavior, and serves only to prevent the staging of any interesting use for those flag bits.  In particular, proper implementation of BOUT in microcode will require another bit.''The Dolphin microcode properly ignores the unused bits.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-Jun-84  9':59':37Attn: JonLAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
