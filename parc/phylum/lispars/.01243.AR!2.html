In fact, on a second attempt at reshaping, I the caret ended up blinking in the title region of the chat window.''-------'Date': 13 Jul 84 15':15 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'To': Burton''I have recategorized this as a window system problem (the reshape code should include "try to keep current position visible" as part of its constraints), and attn''ed you.  The same problem is true of other windows, eg. an exec or break window.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 15':18':09</pre>
