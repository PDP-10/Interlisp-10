Manually setting the vmemsize does not help.  (The vmemsize is increased but Install File still fails with the "insufficient disk space" message) .  Reverting to an earlier version of the tool (Installlisptool.bcd) lets me install the sysout ''----''Sannella --- talking with Kris later, it appears that even using the old version of the installation tool didn''t help --- he got the same error.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Le.pasaEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 14':49':02Attn: JFUNG.PASAAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: 'The "insufficient disk space" error refers to the working pages on Diagnostic volume.  In this particular case, the user has his own files in Diag. volume.  The 1108UG has been changed to include a new step':  "delete *", (delete all users files), prior to install LispInstallatioTool.bcd  We (Patty & I--Jerry--) have notified Kris already.System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: 1108Disk: SA1000 (10MB)Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 8191File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: FatalPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
