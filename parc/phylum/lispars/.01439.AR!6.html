See page 17.7  The documentation says -- "... Restores the current expression to the expression before the last "big jump", e.g., a find command, an &uarr;, or another \.  For example, if the user type F COND, and then F CAR, \ would take him back to the COND.  Another \ would take him back to the CAR. ... "  I use this to jump quickly from the break window into the editor for the last thing I editted.  Like lots of this stuff, it''s just shorthand.  My usual mode of operation is to set a break inside a fn, run it, and then jump into the editor so I can eval pieces of the partially executed fn and check its progress.  If everything is ok, I exit, then OK to the break.  This isn''t much of a win generally, but if you''re watching state change while inside of a loop, \ is much shorter to type than "DF TranslateExprFromGoalVarsToDSTDVars", as I have to do...  If I never took my hand off the mouse, it would be even faster.''-- DMR --''-----''Date':  6 Jun 84 17':27 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Random Lisp suggestions'In-reply-to': dmrussell.pa''s message of Wed, 6 Jun 84 19':52 EDT'To': dmrussell.pa'cc': Burton.pa, LispSupport.pa''The fact that \ worked in the Break window was simply a hang-over from the kludgy DWIM interface that said if some atom wasn''t recognized at toplevel, but in fact was the name of an editor command, then re-enter the editor and . . .''But most of us disliked DWIM''s notion of preguessing our intentions, and Larry removed the kludge a couple weeks ago.''Nevertheless, the point you bring up is an exceedingly important one -- I think the MacLisp world''s notion of "single step execution debugger" would be one reasonable answer.  One of the ISI folks (DonC@ISI) implemented a similar sort of debugger for Interlisp/VAX, and the basic "hook" needed to make it run went into our system a couple months ago.  Would you like to be an "alpha" volunteer to try out their debugger?

"Feature" removals are just as important to get out of the document as feature additions are.  ''The reason I liked \, and wanted it put into the break pop-up, was because it was a quick way to go from the break into the editor without having to type a long edit command.  (In my case, I would have to type something like DF TranslateExprFromGoalVarsToDSTDVars -- this gets quickly boring when the break is set inside a loop.)  ''Re': Single step debugger.  We practically have one now in Dedit.  At least, that''s the way I often use Dedit.  Works fine.  What else would this MacLisp debugger do for me?   Sure, I''ll try anything once -- but not right now.
