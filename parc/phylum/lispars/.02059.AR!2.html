I think this is only an Interlisp-10 limitiation, not Interlisp-D.  (The whole notion of "channel" is peculiar to the 10 I think, and not particularly illuminating.  Perhaps we could redescribe this concept?)  But I don''t think there is any interesting limit in D.''Second, it says that when the interrupt is typed the bell is rung.  Is that the way we are describing things, given that we don''t have bells?''Third, in the description of the TYP/FORM argument, it doesn''t mention CTL-T or RAID.  Do they belong their?''And finally, it says that the value of INTERRUPTCHAR can be given back to INTERRUPTCHAR to restore things.  Given back as which argument?   If it is given as the CHAR argument, then it must be the case that CHAR can be other things besides a character or character code.  A list of (char type/form hardflg)?   ''Also my impression is that the value of INTERRUPTCHAR doesn''t really return the HARDFLG, so that the statement is not exactly true. ''This has to be investigated, and perhaps both the documentation or the implementation changed.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':31':31</pre>
