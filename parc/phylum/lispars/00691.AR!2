It strikes Dorados almost exclusively.  I might include it in "Known problems with this release", but customers (Dolphin and Dandelion users) are unlikely to ever encounter it.''That "opening a Chat window" makes it go away is largely coincidence, I believe.  It goes away by itself after a few minutes.''Bill''[mjs 4/13/84 --- last message forwarded to Dietterich.pa]Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
