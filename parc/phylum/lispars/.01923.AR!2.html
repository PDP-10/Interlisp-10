We could simply tighten up its definition to require returning the full directory name, much as INFILEP returns a full file name.  At least the Leaf version of this already does coerce to canonical names': (DIRECTORYNAMEP ''{ROSE}&lt;LISP&gt;) =&gt; {ROSEBOWL}&lt;LISP&gt;.''I like GETDIRINFO.  I could imagine combining GETDEVINFO and GETDIRINFO if we want to avoid proliferating names, but it would probably be cleaner to keep them separate.''And what about a generic CREATEDIRECTORY?''	Bill''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 17':53':52</pre>
