One of those portions held a bunch of usermacros, in'USERMACROS coms.  The comment I put in front of that section was'(* * USERMACROS).  When I loaded the file with LDFLG = SYSLOAD, I'ended up with USERMACROS unbound.  Why?  Apparently the functions'that go around smashing comslists when a file is SYSLOADed'thought that USERMACROS was a list whose value was to be used for'the * com!  Ugh.  It should of course not do this for * coms.''        --- Mitchell'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 27-Aug-84 22':25':24</pre>
