I noticed that one or two might make for backward incompatibility, e.g., changing the way that FLOAT compiles to use a little microcode assist. No big deal, but release message should probably warn in general about compiling in NEW sysout and loading into OLD.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 16':58':57</pre>
