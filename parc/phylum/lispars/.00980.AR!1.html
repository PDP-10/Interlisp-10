''You are, I believe, the source of interest in rationals.   Do you know of anyone else using them?  Is all of your code "clean" -- i.e., do you use the record forms "create" and "fetch" rather than CONS and CAR ?''A side comment': (MAKERATIONAL &lt;rational&gt;) drops into a break.''-- JonL --''-----''Date':  2 May 84 12':18 PDT'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Rational numbers not yet quite "rational"'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 1 May 84 17':51 PDT'To': JonL.pa'cc': Kaplan.pa, LispSupport.pa''I use rationals in INTERPRESS, which requires them.  There are some records there and a couple of operations defined for them (RPLUS, RTIMES--just the ones I needed).  The function MAKERATIONAL was provide in the floating point package by Bill, to help me do the conversions that I needed.  Interpress''s use of these things is entirely thru field accesses, even though they are in fact represented by  a CONS pair.''There has been no attempt to do a general implementation of rational arithmetic.  If someone is tempted, feel free to provide a more general interface and to remove the code from INTERPRESS to somemore desireable file.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  4-May-84 12':02':03Attn: kaplan, jonlAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: ArithmeticMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
