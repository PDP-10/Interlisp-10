I get an error such as "{LINEDESCRIPTOR}#6,65000 - NON-NUMERIC ARG".  Checking the most recent occurrence, I see the stack'     \LISPERROR'     IDIFFERENCE'     \TEDIT.FIXCHANGEDPART'     TEDIT.UPDATE.SCREEN'     \TEDIT.DELTE'     TEDIT.DELETE'     ...my fns...'     \TEDIT.COMMAND.LOOP'The \TEDIT.FIXCHANGEDPART frame has'     TEXTOBJ = {TEXTOBJ}#6,20000'     STARTINGLINE = NIL'     WINDOW = {WINDOW}#5,65310'     LINES = {LINEDESCRIPTOR}#6,52550'     YBOT = 364'     TEXTLEN = 9281'     THISLINE = {THISLINE}#4,53512'     WHEIGHT = 376'     all others = NIL'and the IDIFFERENCE frame has'     X = {LINEDESCRIPTOR}#6,65000'     Y = 12'Possibly, TEDIT could be reacting badly to some other newly introduced problems with CTRL-shift deletion and Substitution which I will indicate in following ARs.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 18-Sep-84 12':24':03
