You get to encode  a string of cddharacters,  interspersed with':''?<char>    wait for char from remote site''e.g., ?_  waits until you see a _.''=    wait for 2 seconds'^<char>   send control-char, e.g. ^M'''<char>    send <char> even if escape.''For the Vax/VMS guy, you probably have to wait for the "':" until you send the username and for the next "':" until you send the password, etc.''-----''Date':  3 APR 84 18':25 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': AR 59': autologin sequence for RS232CHAT'To':   LispSupport'cc':   masinter, jonl''I''d like to decline this particular in favor of the existing RS232LOGIN'machinery.  Perhaps another AR needs to be generated "Please document'RS232LOGIN".  ''P.S.  RS232LOGIN currently seems to be broken, and I''ve lent my MODEM'   out to someone (who? not sure, maybe Halverson), so I''ll have to get'   it fixed before wanting others to read the documentation.  It got'   broken once last fall when Bill changed the contents of'   the data in LOGINPASSWORDS (he flubbed an edit trying to update RS232LOGIN), but the particular problem now sseems to be deeper.''-----''Date': 11 Apr 84 18':44 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': AR#59'In-reply-to': Lispsupport''s message of 11 Apr 84 17':38':13 PST (Wednesday)'To': Lispsupport.PA'cc': vanMelle.PA, JonL.PA''The situation is still the same as when commented on Apr 3.''By the bye, I don''t think there is any connection with Ethernet CHAT, so unless Bill explicitly is interested in this problem . . .

My own experiments with the GSLVAX confirm the conjecture.  You can perform the experiment yourself of typing the initial CR by hand, and then providing your input file via Chat''s "Input" command, and see that this all works fine.''I don''t know how your Mesa tool works, but perhaps it pauses between sending lines, which would be sufficient to get around the problem.  In fact, I found that the following piece of advice, which tells Chat to immediately send out the current packet after every CR (instead of buffering further typein), is sufficient when running on a Dolphin chatting to a Vax that is one hop away':''(ADVISE ''(BOUT IN CHAT.TYPEIN) ''AFTER'	''(AND (EQ BYTE 13) (BSPFORCEOUTPUT STREAM)))''This seems like a reasonable thing for Chat to do anyway, so I think I''ll make this change next time I''m in that code.  Let me know if this ADVISE fixes your problem.''	Bill'''----------------------------------------------------------------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.paEdit-Date: 19-Apr-84 12':00':18Attn: vanMelle,JonLAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm': I''m still not sure if this is Documentation or implementation]System: CommunicationsSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
