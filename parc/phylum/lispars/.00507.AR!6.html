Teknowledge claims that at least once per day per 1108, Lisp aborts with 9016 or 9318 MP codes.  Teknowledge staff still prefer to timeshare on the 2060 rather than risk losing work on the 1108.  Because of  (1) above, I was unable to  find a way to reproduce these problems for Bill van Melle.  I will schedule another trip with the 0915 problem has stabilized. ''-----''The customer complains of getting 9318 and 9016 at least once per day per 1108.  These happen intermittently and cannot be reliably reproduced.  They suggest it happens more frequently under heavy multiprocessing; it also happens with one large program being loaded or being run.  They feel unpredictable crashes are debilitating.  Software development continues on the 2060 until the DLions are more reliable.''-----''Date':  5 Apr 84 15':23 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 507': Intermittent MP codes 9318/9016'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 5 Apr 84 14':44':01 PST (Thursday)'To': LispSupport.pa''This is System/Subsys unknown, Attn 1100Support until we are given further information.
