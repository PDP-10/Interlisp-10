Tioga uses the Laurel convention of placeholders that allows you to fill in forms easily.  If you hit the placeholder key (the middle unmarked key on the right) the editor moves the selection to the next placeholder in the document.  This can be used to fill out forms (as this Lisp report) or to fill in parameters on a function call.  In Cedar, if you type a procedure name and then ^E, the procedure name will be followed by a form for all of the parameters (sort of like what ?= does).  Then you can fill in the parameters one by one, moving from one parameter to the next just by hitting the placeholder key.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Mar-84 19':29':20Attn: Sybalsky.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
