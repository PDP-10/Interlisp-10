I may not have told everyone of the change, though.  You are the last holdout in the loadup, as Mike tells me when I rashly removed KILL.ME from the system.  You call it in \TEDIT1, \TEDIT.RESTARTFN and \TEDIT2.  If you can change these calls to PROCESS.RETURN I can be rid of KILL.ME.  Meanwhile, I put KILL.ME back in proc.''	Bill''-----''Date': 28 Jun 84 18':25 PDT'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': TEdit': u.d.f.

I prematurely deleted the function KILL.ME, which had been dedocumented over a year ago.  I have temporarily reinstated it until Tedit and others catch up.  Workaround': (MOVD ''PROCESS.RETURN ''KILL.ME).''If you have code that calls KILL.ME, please use PROCESS.RETURN instead.  Tedit is the only system program that calls KILL.ME, but there may be user packages as well. RPC and EVALSERVER were the only ones I see in a quick scan of LispUsers and Library.''For the record, here are other long dedocumented functions that have been removed from PROC (and of which I could find no trace in the system)': PROCESS.SWITCH.TO.WINDOW, WITHOUT.PROCESSES, PREEMPT.KEYBOARD.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalskyEdit-Date: 16-Jul-84 16':49':00</pre>
