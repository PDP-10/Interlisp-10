That is, if you create a message editor, create in it a plain text message, and punch deliver, the system thinks you have created a formatted message and puts up its "send plain/formatted text" menu.  Problems':''1.  Filling in the menu to say plain text all the time is a minor nuisance.''2.  If by accident you say send formatted, the formatting (even if there are no annotations in what you typed) will be anno/editmark formatting, which means that if the recipient of the message doesn''t have anno loaded, he''s dead meat in the street.''3.  That of course means that you can''t send a message with TEdit formatting alone.''Would like':''a.  Would like anno/editmark stuff not to creep unbidden into documents.''b.  Might also be nice to expand and revise the meaning of the send plain/formatted text menu when anno/editmark is loaded':'Send plain text': strip out all Tedit and anno stuff'Send formatted': strip out all anno stuff'Send annotated': send as is.''-- Tayloe.''-----''Date': 24 Jul 84 10':24 PDT'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': Anno': Messages think they''re formatted when they ain''t'In-reply-to': stansbury.pa''s message of 21 Jul 84 01':06 PDT'To': stansbury.pa'cc': TEditSupport.pa, Lafitesupport.pa, Poduska.pasa''I think this is because the style information that the entered text is NEW is being kept.
