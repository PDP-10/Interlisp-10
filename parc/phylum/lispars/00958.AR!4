"... move TTY-process from Top level typescript window to the window ..."''Windows are not processes.  Perhaps user has misconception here.''2.  " ... (TTY.PROCESS (THIS.PROCESS)) ... "''What process is user running in when he does this?''3.  "I lose the control of defined BUTTONEVENTFN property in this window"''Explain "lose the control", please.'''The most likely thing I can think of is that the code is running under the mouse process, and user has neglected to read about the function ALLOW.BUTTON.EVENTS, which is a necessity for BUTTONEVENTFN to run while user is running code under the mouse process.  There is an AR on documentation related to this (555).''	Bill''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 15-May-84 14':29':25
