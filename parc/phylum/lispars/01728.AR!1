E.g. LOOPFN': "A function to be called each time thru the character-read loop."  Does this function take 0, 1 2, or more arguments?  What are they?  Do you get the character typed?  Etc.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 31-Jul-84 12':46':30Attn: Sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
