At least on the Dorado, it would free up 'substantial amounts of microcode space if we could get rid of the remaining 'needs. '  we could either retain the current bootstrap/with/BCPL or convert over to a 'new boot regime (which would allow faster startup on Dorado, a real pain now to'swap in your workingset. ''I think the main tasks are to move the thernet controller from BCPL into Lisp ('which may solve some of the performance problems and also some bugs with the 'Dorado ethernet controller) and to move the disk controller into Lisp (maybe it'is there already). Can you fill this AR out some more, Bill?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: vanMelle, jonlAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
