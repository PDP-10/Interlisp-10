I''m thinking of an aid to tracking down where a program is doing lots of consing': histograms of amount of storage consed up underneath a given routine. This would be great for tuning my TCP code, for example, to see where I''m generating FIXPs and so on.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Performance ToolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
