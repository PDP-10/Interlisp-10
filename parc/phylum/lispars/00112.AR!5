For devices which are external to the machine and which might change state over a LOGOUT or SYSOUT, it is important that FULLNAME actually be an identifier of the stream, so that the across-logout across-sysout feature can attempt to re-find the file.''For some devices, e.g., the STRING device, there is no good handle of that form, and (FULLNAME STREAM) should return STREAM. This is achieved by making the FULLNAME field of the stream be NIL (to avoid circularities.)''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  3-Apr-84 17':14':22Attn: lispAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: DocumentationSubsystem: Internal System DocumentationMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
