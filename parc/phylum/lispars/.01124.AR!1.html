Instead of being a no-op, this closes and opens/redisplays the window, a rather annoying hiccup in places like the backtrace frame window.''Just offhand, it looks like it would be a pain to fix this in ATTACHWINDOW.  So how about having SHAPEW treat request to shape to the same region to be a no-op?  A nice, but less important addition, would be to have it treat a shaping to the same shape but different position to be a MOVEW..Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 18-May-84 12':26':58Attn: BurtonAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
