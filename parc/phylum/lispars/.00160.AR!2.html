Thus, @ encodes 0000, A encodes 0001, B encodes 0010, etc. up to O.  We did it with this half-dense encoding so as to avoid characters with any special properties on lisp symbolic files.''An example':''(8 2 "@B" "CF")''These s-expression representations are simply printed on the file by PRINTBITMAP and the bitmaps command, and read and converted back to a real bitmaps by READBITMAP.''Hope this helps.''Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 14-Jun-84 15':09':27Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
