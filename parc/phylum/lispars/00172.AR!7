I edited LOGOW so that it didn''t do the "hard" case of FTIMES, but now it dies underneath SIN, calling FREMAINDER.''Could it be that the UFNs for these guys you changed recently are schrod?'I''ve left the "corpse" on Plaza, which is connected to the terminal in'1623.  It was sort of in a half-way WINDOWworld state, and I called RAID'manually to see what was going on.''Maybe one of you could look at it before someone else snatches Plaza.'-----'Date': 14 Mar 84 19':58 PST'From': masinter.pa'Subject': Re': Changes to FPLUS, FTIMES'In-reply-to': JONL.PA''s message of 14 MAR 84 06':00 PST'To': JONL.PA'cc': MASINTER.PA, VANMELLE.PA, LISPCORE^.PA''It seems unreasonable to edit LOGOW to fix a suspected bug in FTIMES, doesn''t it?''I tried finding any problems with arithmetic in the INIT.DLINIT and haven''t been so far.

Another way of isolating the problem is to change the loadup script to''(SETQ SYSOUT (MAKEINIT --))''(load in RDSYS )'(DLFIXINIT SYSOUT --)''i.e., to make sure that RDSYS doesn''t interfere with the MAKEINIT files.'-----'Date': 16 MAR 84 11':36 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': Re': opcodes list reconstructed, new loadups on <LispCore>Next>'To':   masinter, LispCore^'cc':   JONL''In response to the message sent  15 Mar 84 01':17 PST from masinter.pa''What *was* the problem with the \OPCODES list?
