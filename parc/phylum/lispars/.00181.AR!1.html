''I think in lieu of really compelling reasons otherwise that that is a bad idea. If you are going to provide both REPLACE and INSERT operations, I would prefer that the BOUT stream operation be REPLACE and tht you provide for INSERT thru some other primitive.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sybalsky.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: Priority: Status: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
