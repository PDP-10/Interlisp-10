Au contraire, there are plenty of Lisp problems lurking there.  Perhaps we have been lulled by a lack of fresh reports on the problem.''Syntelligence have had so many problems NSFiling that they have basically quit using it, and are relying on floppy and flaky {dsk} to store their stuff.  They have however been able to sysout to their fileserver successfully with their pre-Carol lisp (thanks largely to Bill''s work on this problem).  Makefile etc. are apparently still a disaster.''NSFiling was a considerable nuisance in the lispcourse in Watford.   File interactions usually (though by no means always) completed successfully.  But they frequently seemed to spawn 3-5 filing processes each, n-1 of which would get confused and periodically promptprint "Filing#i not responding" ad infinitum.  Why it takes more than one process to accomplish a makefile I don''t know.  It seems as if all the spurious processes were waiting for the fileserver to tell them something, but were not reminding the fileserver they were waiting to be served.  And sometimes file interactions broke, usually when trying to close a file. People at the course who had NS fileservers at home said that they had the same problems on their own installations. ''It seems that after the thaw, we must allocate some resources to fixing the Lisp end of NSFiling.  For starters, we must appoint some Phylex users': to the best of my knowledge, NO ONE is using it now.  I for one volunteer.  But I do not wish to be alone.  And once NSFiling seems solid, I don''t see any reason why we can''t tackle transparently caching files on the local disk -- it can''t take more than a couple days to design and implement.''-- Tayloe.'-----'Date': 21 Feb. 1984 1':18 pm PST (Tuesday)'From': Raim.pasa'Subject': Re': Lisp': NS Filing': Raised Priority'In-reply-to': Stansbury.pa''s message of 16 Feb 84 19':25 PST'To': Stansbury.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa, Cooper.pa, Sheil.pa''Tayloe,''I am considering Jerry Fung as the NS-networking resource for this problem.
