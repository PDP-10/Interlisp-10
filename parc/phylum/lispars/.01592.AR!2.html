Number: 1592Date:  9-Jul-84 16':59':51Submitter: Le.pasaSource:  Martin YonkeSubject: Want DEDIT to run in the process world "correctly."Lisp Version: Description: 'This is an appeal to raise the priority of getting DEDIT to run in the'process world "correctly."''In the normal program development environment, you can get along fairly'well as is w.r.t. DEDIT.  The one exception is when you have a MS'Browser up and select a function to edit while already having a DEDIT'process running, you are informed that you have to start the edit from'within the DEDIT process.  Even that is OK although possibly a bit'annoying.  However, if you use the display editor as a tool to edit'other "objects" whose list representation is generated on the fly and'"decomposed" when the edit is complete and the easiest way to refer to'these objects is by pointing to one of their "presentations" on the'display and selecting ''edit'' on a popup menu that appears, then being'told that you cannot do the edit because another edit is in progress'really impedes effectiveness (especially when you want to copy pieces of'structure from one object to the other).''I realize our use of DEDIT is not part of the original intent of DEDIT,'but our use has proven to be a very effective method of modifying objects'modulo this problem that we can only do it to one object at a time.''Thanks for listening and I hope this helps raise DEDIT''s conversion to'the process world priority somewhat.''Martin'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Jul-84 14':20':14Attn: Sheil.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
