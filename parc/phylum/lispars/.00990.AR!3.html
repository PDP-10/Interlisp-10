BT and its friends start at LASTPOS.  The backtrace menu sets LASTPOS to the selected frame.  This allows things like ?=, REVERT and ARGS to work on the selected frame.  I am pretty sure that is the desired action in most cases.  ''I will update the documentation BT and friends to point out that LASTPOS can be set by selecting the display backtrace.
