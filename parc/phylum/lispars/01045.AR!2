I hope that you can help me out.''- When I run CHAT from a lengthy input typescript, CHAT stops reading from the typescript after a couple of transactions and just hangs. (It typically hangs in the middle of reading the 3rd transaction - before it reaches the CR for that line. It appears to think that it has reached the end of the typescript and closes the input file.)  When I limit the number of transactions in the input typescript to < 3 transactions, I don''t run into this problem. Is there any way around this besides running only short typescript?''- I need to be able to invoke pop-up menu items from within my code. How can I do this?  I specifically need to be able to "Close" and "Dribble" (record) the CHAT session.  I also need to know when I should stop recording the session or when the last transaction (from the input typescript) has been read.''- A more trivial problem': When I supply Chat with a window, it closes the window once after the last transaction has been invoked. Can this be prevented?''Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.''-- Sandy''-------'Date': 13 Aug 84 18':51 PDT'From': acuff.pa''   When looking for CHAT AR''s that I might have affected, I ran across this one.  This could well be a VAX problem if there is no flow control.  I''ve had problems with vaxen not taking type-ahead.  You probably already knew that, but in case you didn''t....''-------'Date': 14 Aug 84 11':11 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''I had claimed it was a Vax problem (and still do), but there seemed little hope of getting the Vax fixed.  What the user really wanted was Chat streams, so that she could programmatically send a command, then wait to see what came back, then send more, etc.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 14-Aug-84 11':15':12
