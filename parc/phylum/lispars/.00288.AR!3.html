After doing so, it appears to still go off consulting the database to see if it lives elsewhere.  That seems like a waste of time.''-----''Date': 26 MAR 84 19':57 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': Re': Lisp': PF/WHEREIS glitch'To':   vanMelle, LispSupport'cc':   JONL''In response to the message sent  23 Mar 84 14':02 PST from vanMelle.pa''The "new" version of WHEREIS that I started work on some time ago, but haven''t had time to develop for the past several weeks, has an optional argument FIRSTONLY which means that the caller would be satisfied with the "first" file, rather than all files found.  Otherwise, the semantics of WHEREIS is that it must search all sources (e.g., FILELST and the hash file database).''If you directly supply the file argument to PF, then it doesn''t call WHEREIS; if you don''t supply that argument, the WHEREIS is called with a "function" to apply to each found file.  You are probably just witnessing the wait between the time it finds the first file, and when it finishes the total search.''Incidentally, this "new" WHEREIS is the one that will integrate the FILEDEFS information into additional hash files -- the "historic" WHEREIS lispusers package only has information about FNS definitions.''-----''From': kaplan.pa'Date': 30-Mar-84 22':52':27 PST'Subject': Re': AR 288': PF searches WHEREIS database unnecessarily'In-reply-to': Your message of 26 Mar 84 12':53':46 PST (Monday)'To': Sannella, Lispsupport'cc': Kaplan''I think that is a feature, not a bug or a waste of time.  There might be several versions of that function on different files that are accessible thru your directoy search list.  PF attempts to show them all to you.''As far as I''m concerned, this AR is closed.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 31-Mar-84 14':51':03Attn: Assigned To: Kaplan.paIn/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
