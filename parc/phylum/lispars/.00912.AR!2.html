For your convenience':''5. Dump Format'''A dump file is a sequence of blocks of eight-bit bytes. The  first byte'of each block is the block type. A typical dump file might look like':'        &lt;name block&gt;&lt;date block&gt;&lt;data block 1&gt;...&lt;data block n&gt;'      .'      .'      &lt;name block&gt;&lt;date block&gt;&lt;data block 1&gt;...&lt;data block m&gt;'      &lt;end block&gt;''Name Block - Type=#377''A name block  contains two bytes of  file attributes and then  the file name. (Ignored by load, set to 0 by Dump).''Data Block - Type=#376''A data block contains two bytes of byte count (high-order  byte first), two bytes of checksum (high-order  byte first), and a sequence  of data bytes.  The  byte  count  must  be  less  than  or  equal  to  256  for compatibility with Novas, and  the count does not include  the checksum or byte  count; only the  data bytes are  counted.  The checksum  is a 16-bit  add ignoring carry,  over the data and byte count. If the block has an odd number of bytes,  the last byte is NOT included in the checksum computation.''End Block - Type=#374''An end block has no contents and terminates a Load.~.''Date Block - Type=#373''Date blocks  with six bytes  of date are  generated; contains the four byte Alto creation date into the first  four bytes and  zeros  the  remaining  two.  Date blocks are optional.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 16':55':36</pre>
