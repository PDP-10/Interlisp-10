Attempting to use DIR, which the manual describes as   DIR files . commands   , causes one to  try and enter the function with a ''.''. This of course is wrong.  An alternative would be to describe the function as 'DIR files command1 command2 ... commandn. This should be clearer to our growing number of business users who will be learning Lisp for the first time.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  6-Aug-84 16':01':21Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: DocumentationSubsystem: Interlisp Reference ManualMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
