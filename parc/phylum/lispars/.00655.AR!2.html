This is wrong--should only be done by TEDIT.  Two effects': clicking in the window makes some random process the Tty process (typically MOUSE, e.g., when called by Lafite''s Display command or background ShowAR); and clicking in the window pops up a menu that makes it look like there IS a process there.  Ideally, clicking in the window should have NO effect, except to bring the window to the top, and do copy selection if shift is down.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.paEdit-Date: 12-Apr-84 16':47':39Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: FixedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
