How about doing the same thing with CHAT': A little arrow in the right; dragging the mouse left gives the menu of hosts?  The little arrow doesn''t have to appear until CHAT.ALLHOSTS has ben set.'--------''Date': 30 Aug 84 22':38 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''I''m going to decline this one.  I see no particular virtue in doing a submenu for this rather than the current way (popping up a second menu of hosts).  At least the way I view the submenu mechanism, it''s a way to provide a clustering of commands.  Chat, on the other hand, is really a single command.  Seeing a submenu does not help the user decide whether "Chat" was the right command to issue.  I realize the distinction can be fuzzy, but I see insufficient motivation for the extra hair here.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 30-Aug-84 22':45':11
