Otherwise you could fail to notice the error mesage and cause it to be overwritten e.g. by mouse help.  It might be better too if the error messages went into the prompt window so that failures in multiple message senders didn''t overwrite each other''s error reports.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 13-Aug-84 12':06':39Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
