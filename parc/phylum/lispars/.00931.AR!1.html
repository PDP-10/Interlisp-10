The text is there (checked by PUTting it out to {DSK}), and the middle-button underlinning even *knows* that it is there since it underlines whole words, regardless of the cruft displayed on the line.''This has happened to me about once every other day for the last couple of weeks, each time, I believe, while using Lafite''s message composer.  Sorry that I can''t be of more help (yet!) in isolating the circumstances leading up to the lossage.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
