Up here, the local INIT files set these variables to the local values.  When a loadup is made, it is necessary to set some of these variables to local PARC values, so the loadup knows where to find font files, for instance, but there is a function ENDLOADUP which should smash all of these variables back to non-PARC values (like {DSK}).  As it happens, STARFONTDIRECTORIES is not getting smashed.  This is also true in Carol.  This is not a serious problem, because the user should always set all of these variables in their INIT files anyways.''(2)  There is an AR to remove Cream from the list of Tedit fonts, or make the default list user-modifyable.''-----'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 27-Jun-84 14':45':50Attn: SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Release ProcedureMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
