Typically, I now experience several MP type errors during a days work.  The information I can offer on the circumstances are unfortunately very sketchy since they are unrecoverable errors,----I can''t even get into Teleraid.  Here is some anecdotal information':''9024 out of nowhere (I have a MAKEFILE process and TEDIT going).  The cursor disappears, UNDO doesn''t give me TELERAID. Multiple STOPs gives me the cursor back and  GC and disk reading/wrinting appears to be going on judging from the shape of the cursor, but mouse doesn''t track, and eventually the display freezes.''....'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 20':19':44Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Virtual MemoryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: OnceImpact: FatalPriority: HopefullyStatus: IncompleteProblem Type: BugSource Files:
