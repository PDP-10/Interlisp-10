Number: 27Date: 16-Mar-84 23':58':19Submitter: roach.paSource: roach.paSubject: Want BACKQUOTE in all delivered FontsLisp Version: Description: 'I wish gacha10 had backquote in it.  A version of gacha10'with backquote is available as {phylum}&lt;lisp&gt;fonts&gt;gacha10.strike.  How'about moving {phylum}&lt;lisp&gt;fonts&gt;gacha8.strike, gacha10.strike, and gacha12.strike to {indigo} so that the gacha fonts in core at loadup have bacquotes?'				Kelly'''--------------'LMM': I think ALL of the fonts that are DELIVERED with Interlisp-D should be put on [phylum]&lt;Lisp&gt;Fonts&gt;  and modified to contain the backquote character. ''As a side note, [phylum]&lt;Lisp&gt;Fonts&gt; should NOT contain any fonts which are NOT delivered. We''ve delivered Gacha/Timesroman and Helvetica in the past-- there are a bunch of other fonts which do not occur on any of our printers and are thus suspect. Also, there is a separate AR to convert to STAR fonts instead of ALTO fonts, which would give a different approach to this problem (the STAR fonts have backquote and other characters in them.)Workaround: Test Case: (BOUT T 96) in any window with dspfont a gacha font.Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-May-84 16':22':23Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm 8Mar': extended for all fonts]System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: FontsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
