Instead, if for some reason you have need of running a Carol-based loadup on a dlion, load it on a Dorado, load all the Klamath-compatible file system files (dlionfs, volumedirectory, volumefilemap, volumeallocationmap) from lispcore&gt;sources, sysout, and run the result on your dlion.''As for patching up your trashed dsk volume, I''m afraid there isn''t much you can do.
