The priority shouldn''t be the other way ''round -- left to right? let the second the file is written and "PDT" fall into oblivion, if something must go?  ''i. Actually, wouldn''t everything work if the title bar scrolled along with the main window? The position of LENGTH and WRITTEN could be calculated in absolute terms from the right, e.g., let WRITTEN be 2 inches from an ersatz right margin (i.e. length of longest line).  Like in lafite, the user could determine the window size, but still expect to scroll. So if the window isn''t big enough, LENGTH will not be visible scrolled.''ii. alternatively, could let long file names occupy 2 or more lines, and have the filebrowser window size be constant. (only if the columns were justified ..)'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':33':52</pre>
