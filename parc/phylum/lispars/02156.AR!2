So something was wrong with the file that I started working with.  (This is not the most recent one, if you want to look, since I was able to dump my edits).''Anyway, with this problem in the file, I got a break on LOADFROMing inside LOADFNSCAN, I think.  Don''t remember exactly what that break was.''But I returned from there, completed the load, made my edits, and then tried to dump.''This time I got a HELP inside PRETTYDEF, with no message at all.''Finally got things to work by SETPROPLISTing the filename to remove bogus properties.''Just thought I''d let you know.  Could be a screw loose on dumping something without any functions (like the INIT).  And the behavior on loading and dumping wasn''t particularly graceful.''Probably the HELP is a mistake.  It must believe that the situation could never occur, therefore not worth causing an explicit error or at least a HELP with an error message.  But the situation depends on the contents of files that live in a dangerous world and are not invulnerable.
