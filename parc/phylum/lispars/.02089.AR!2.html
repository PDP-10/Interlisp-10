That is in the line "... and the segment between THEN and the next ELSE or ELSEIF as the consequent(s)."  Where that "(s)" implies multiple forms.  If you felt like adding a sentence explicitly mentioning that you allow multiple exprs I think new users would be helped.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':39':06</pre>
