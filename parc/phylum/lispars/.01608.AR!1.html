Number: 1608Date: 10-Jul-84 14':55':27Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Sannella.PASubject: Want standard way to change cursor so it will be changed backLisp Version: Description: 'Date':  2 Jul 84 11':05 PDT'From': Newman.pasa'Subject': Lisp':  Cursor reverts to  default cursor after entering and leaving a LAFITE window.'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Newman.pasa'Lisp-System-Date':  8-Jun-84 11':31':06'Machine-Type': Dandelion''   As the topic says, the cursor reverts to the default cursor after entering and leaving a LAFITE window.  That is to say, I set the cursor to a different bitmap, but after entering and leaving the LAFITE  browser window, it reverted to the  default bitmap.  Is this a bug?  It seems to me that one shoud be able to set the cursor to another bitmap and have it remain as that bitmap without interference from other processes. '''''   Thanks (in advance) for your help.''''   --Dave'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: BurtonAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
