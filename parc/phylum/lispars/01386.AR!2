To avoid having irrelevant or possibly misleading info in the report, I clear all those fields.  It would be nice if I could do that in one easy step, rather than wipe them out one at a time.  This would be something like having a "Enter second-hand AR" button.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 15':01':38
