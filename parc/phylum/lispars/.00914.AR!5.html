More likely, "object oriented programming" would give us the same thing, e.g., make GETPROPLIST cause message pass on non-atoms.

GETPROPLIST and SETPROPLIST'could be made to work on all lisp objects, maintaining the existing'implementation for non-NIL LITATOMs.  Datatypes tending to have plists'should just have their plist cells built into them.  Objects with'non-NIL plists but no built in plist should be hashed in a hash table.'(Two numbers should be considered the same object if they are IEQP or'FEQP.)  This workable scheme is essentially what is done in the lisp'variant BRANDX, for example.  The advantages of the scheme are upwards'compatibility, less need to emulate Interlisp code, and easier use of'some user''s packages.'				Kelly'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date:  4-Sep-84 14':16':17</pre>
