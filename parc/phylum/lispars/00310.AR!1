The effect of this is that when the relative parity of the display stream to the screen changes (b/c of a mOVEW or SCROLLW), then subsequent use of the same shade will not align with existing uses (so it will not erase when XORd, for example).''Example':'  (SETQ W (CREATEW))'  (DSPFILL NIL 3598 W ''INVERT)   (* Shades)'  (DSPFILL NIL 3598 W ''INVERT)   (* Clears)'  (DSPFILL NIL 3598 W ''INVERT)   (* Reshades)'  (RELMOVEW W ''(1 . 1))               (* Off by 1)'  (DSPFILL NIL 3598 W ''INVERT)   (* SHRIEK!)''This is a moderately serious bug which requires a clumsy workaround in DEdit and anyone else who shades with textured patterns in user adjustable windows.''Beau'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
