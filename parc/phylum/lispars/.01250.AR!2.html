For example I just got new mail into my Operability folder, thinking it was my active folder. I then started to process messages. In the course of this, I tried to Move one to Operability. Nothing happened. I thought that Lafite was broken. Then I discovered my wrong assumption. Then I understood what was going on. ''Suggestion': Indicate as an error any attempt to move a message to the same folder out of which you are moving it. How? Flash, or pop-up, or prompt.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date:  5-Jun-84 14':19':48</pre>
