An option in Lafite''s MOVETO destination menu which enables you to specify an AR number.  This would add the message to the description field of the AR, perhaps in the background.''Also, an Answer command in the AR, which will bring up a message form filled in with the various people who are related to the AR':  the submitter, the assigned to, perhaps various people in the disposition field who made comments.  The answer message, when it is complete and delivered by Lafite, would then also automatically go into the AR.''Or perhaps the other way around':  You edit the message into the description field of the AR, then when you feel like it, you bug a Sendmsg option, and it takes what you''ve editted and puts it in a pre-addressed message form.''Finally, one other point about AR':  It should not let you edit anything in the previous description comments.  The old descriptions should be write-protected, since they represent a sort of history.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
