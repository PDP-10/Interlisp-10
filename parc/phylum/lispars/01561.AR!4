I am told that there exists a font called Terminal for Interpress printers that is fixed width and roughly (if not entirely) equivalent to GACHA.''I''ve looked at the Interpress code ({PHYLUM}<LISPCORE>SOURCES>INTERPRESS, which has been moved to {ERIS}<LISP>SOURCES>) and found a DMACRO called .IPFONTNAME. that seems to do the substitution (Modern for Helvetica, Classic for Timesroman, etc.).  Perhaps all that is needed is an extra line in the SELECTQ to return ''Terminal if FAMILY is ''GACHA.'-------'Date': 28 Jun 84 14':46 PDT'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': AR-Submit'In-reply-to': FEUERMAN''s message of 28 Jun 84 11':31 PDT'To': FEUERMAN.pasa'cc': Le.pasa, 1100Support.pasa, Kaplan.pa''Ken,''I fixed this and tried it out.  It turns out that our printer does not have Terminal in size 10, so the resulting file comes out as garbage.  Do you have a printer with Terminal 10?  If so, can you test the code for me?  What do customers have?''--Ron''-----''Date': 17 Aug 84 14':20 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': AR#1561, Interpress font substitution'To': nuyens, kaplan'cc': Feuerman.pasa, LispSupport''I marked this AR as "fixed", although there is still the issue of Terminal 10 not resolved.''Was that the right thing to do?''-----''Date': 17 Aug 84 14':29 PDT'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1561, Interpress font substitution'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 17 Aug 84 14':20 PDT'To': Masinter.pa'cc': nuyens.pa, kaplan.pa, Feuerman.pasa, LispSupport.pa''Fonts are still a disaster, independent of this AR, and independent of Terminal 10, altho that would help a bit.''John and I are thinking about it.''--Ron''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 09':27':43
