For instance, as a result of repeated Brownie''ing {Phylum/Eris}<Lisp>Current> into {Ice}<Lisp>Current> over time a lot of files in the latter directory are now obsolete. ''I propose the option PURGE as follows':'	(COPYFILES	''{Eris}<Lisp>Current>'				''{Ice}<Lisp>Current>'				''(>A PURGE))''updates the destination dir from the source dir with all obsolete files purged.''-- Hans'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
