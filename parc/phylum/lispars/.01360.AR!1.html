One source seems to be break.  Every time I enter a break (say, at level 1), I get a different window (as determined by (WHICHW (GETPOSITION))).  This is true even if I set CLOSEBREAKWINDOWFLG to NIL.  As I understand things, this means that every time I enter a break, the bits underneath the window must be recalculated and put into the occlusion stack.  I suspect this means that a new bitmap is being created.''--Tom'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  5-Jun-84 16':04':17Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
