''They happen intermittently.  ''The first problem is that no files can be written onto the Lisp and Lispusers directories on Rosebowl.  Attempts using COPYFILE are followed by a request for the connect password.  After the correct password is given, a break window opens declaring': "FILE WON''T OPEN".  This is the same as the response to an incorrect password.''Chat, on the other hand, will accept absolutely anything as a password when trying to connect to one of these directories.  I CONNected to Lispusers and typed garbage in for the password.  Then I successfully executed a DELete.  I tried simply using DIR to connect to the directory, and proceeded to DELete a file without the system asking me to type in a password.''Judy and Lorraine have also encountered these problems.''We are all using the same Full.sysout (8 June).''-----''Sender': Sannella.PA'Date': 13 Jul 84 17':53':23 PDT (Friday)'Subject': Re': Lisp': PASSWORD problems'In-reply-to': Barrera.pasa''s message of 13 Jul 84 16':51 PDT'To': Barrera.pasa'cc': LispSupport'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''"Cant COPYFILE"''This is a known problem, which has been fixed, and will be in the Harmony  release (see AR 458).''"Chat allows you to delete protected files"''This is not Lisp''s problem --- all chat does is give you a way to talk to the telnet server on the IFS rosebowl.
