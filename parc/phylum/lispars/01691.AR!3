The error is "NIL - ILLEGAL ARG" and occurs in OPENSTRINGSTREAM.  As this is very easy to reproduce I won''t bother giving you a full stack backtrace.  However, the immediate caller is ICONW.FORMATLINE, and that was called from ICONTITLE.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 18-Aug-84 11':24':13
