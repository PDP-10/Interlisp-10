If you try to remove the last user-defined property from a process, only the property value, not both the value and name, get removed from the list.  I think Bill made a transcribing error when he copied WINDOWPROP.  There''s a CDDR that should be a CDDDR in the RPLACD clause that smashes the list.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':42':51Attn: Assigned To: vanMelle.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: '[Date':  8 Apr 84 16':36 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': new PROC'This fixes AR''s 101]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
