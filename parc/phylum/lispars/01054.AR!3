To experiment with this, I added a new variable WINDOWTITLESHADE which is the shade that the title bar has following the printed text.  It is initial BLACKSHADE which works the old way.  If you play with it, let me know what you think.''richard''-----''Date': 17 May 84 10':50 PDT'From': Burton.pa'Subject': changes to window in loadup'To': LispFriends^''I liked the new WINDOWTITLESHADE feature so much that I changed the default to a cross hatch pattern.  It "softens" the screen a lot and makes it much easier to distinquish the tops of overlapping windows.  If enough people don''t like it I will change it back.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 12':21':04Attn: Assigned To: Burton.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: ClosedProblem Type: Source Files:
