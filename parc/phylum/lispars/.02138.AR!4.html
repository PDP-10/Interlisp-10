It printed OK, but the watchdog process identified the printing job as'   PARC on print':PARC'in the promptwindow.''Seems odd to me.  I don''t know whether this is a problem in NSPRINT, or in the LPT closing thing, or what.  Could it be that (FILENAMEFIELD x ''NAME) is being used to figure out how to identify the thing, and that gives PARC, since LISPPRINT': according to FILENAMEFIELD is a DEVICE or somesuch.''The printerdevice CLOSEF function I know does it''s own STRPOS''s so as not to get confused by the colon.  But maybe someone else down the line is getting confused?''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter</pre>
