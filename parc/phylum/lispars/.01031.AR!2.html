During this, you can''t do anything with the msg browser, for sync. reasons.''(2) Then TEdit does the hardcopy formatting.  This IS done in background, but is prone not to block, so you may well be locked out because the hardcopy process won''t let go.  I could add occasional BLOCKs to the hardcopy code, if it''s a big problem....''	--John'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 18-Aug-84 11':17':58</pre>
