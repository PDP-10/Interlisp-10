I finally found the problem --- it looks like the compiler is compiling RESETFORM wrong, or at least differently than it used to.  The problem appeared to be in the code for AR.REPLACE.FIELD.VAL, as follows':''(DEFINEQ'(AR.REPLACE.FIELD.VAL'  (LAMBDA (OBJ CH# W NEWVAL)'        (DECLARE (SPECVARS OBJ CH# W NEWVAL))'        (RESETFORM (RADIX 10)'          (PROG ((STREAM (TEXTSTREAM W))'                 (NEWVAL.NCHARS (NCHARS NEWVAL))'                 INSERT.CH# SEL)'.'.'.''TEXTSTREAM broke with bad argument - NIL.''Using PRINTCODE, I discovered that AR.REPLACE.FIELD.VALA0001 (the function generated by RESETFORM) contained the lines''Local args':'100':	117	110':	2	IVAR 2': W'102':	116	112':	1	IVAR 1': V'104':	115	114':	0	IVAR 0': W''It appears that W was being bound as a localvar inside AR.REPLACE.FIELD.VALA0001.''I got around the problem by renaming W -&gt; WINDOW, but I think that this is a bug.  This function used to compile without this problem.'Workaround: Test Case: '{eris}&lt;sannella&gt;Lisp&gt;AREDIT;37'{eris}&lt;sannella&gt;Lisp&gt;AREDIT.DCOM;32Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date:  1-Sep-84 11':52':11</pre>
