There is no recursion, and not even any deep function calling, under \HANDLE.NS.ROUTING.INFO, so it is unlikely to be the culprit.  As I''ve mentioned, the stack overflow break is not guaranteed to happen in the process that was "guilty" (see Ar 619': Make stack overflow happen in process with deepest stack).'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 14-May-84 12':40':39</pre>
