That''s because those characters delimit file name fields, and Lisp has to have some way of parsing the file name.  E.g., in the name you mention''Mail129-May-84 17':55':44 -1''Lisp thinks you mean the file "44 -1" on the device "Mail129-May-84 17':55".  What we really need, then, is some quoting convention for special characters in file names.''There should be no problem with spaces, except that, since they are separator characters, you have to escape them in order to get them into a litatom and hence into a filename.  E.g., to enter the filename above you would have to actually type''Mail129-May-84% 17':55':44% -1''to get that name to be read as a single atom instead of three.''	Bill''--------'Date': 22 Jul 84 23':11 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1506': NS problems': GETFILEINFO crash if file name contains bad chars'To': MGittins.rx, 1100Support.pasa'cc': vanMelle.pa''I believe I have fixed it so that GETFILEINFO doesn''t crash if the name is funny; also, more funny names parse successfully.  I have changed the subject of the AR to "Want quoting convention for special characters in NS file names".''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 24-Jul-84  9':51':07Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: NS ProtocolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
