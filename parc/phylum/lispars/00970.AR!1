I got Richard Burton to look at it, and he decided that it was a long-standing mis-feature':  errors at this early phase cause a call to \TTYOUTCHARFN, which isn''t defined yet, which causes an error, etc...  In this case, the first error was caused by \LEAF.TIMEOUT.  I don''t know what could be done about it, but it might as well be in the AR database.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  4-May-84  9':55':35Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
