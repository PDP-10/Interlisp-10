If I just try editting it without loading it, it won''t complain until I try to clean it up.  If I load it first, it doesn''t notice that I''ve editted it.  I mentioned this to Ron Kaplan and he seemed to have some idea of what the problem might be.  He said it had something to do with the fact that the Init file got loaded in a funny way in the beginning.''Thanks,''John.

Why isn''t this done now?''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 21':56':45Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: MasinterIn/By: Disposition: [I changed it so that the system init gets loaded with (LOAD sysinit ''SYSLOAD) and the user init file gets loaded with (LOAD initfile T) .
