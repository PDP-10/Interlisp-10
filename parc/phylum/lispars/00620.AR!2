I think has to do with BIG changing the fonts.  With the demo loaded, the function names appear in large (helvetica 18?) font with the line spacing being only 12 or so.  Scrolling off and back on print the function names in a smaller font which has the right linefeed height but the width of the selection is still as if they were printed in the larger font.''-----''Date': 10 Apr 84 12':31 PST'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': New Dedit looks bad with BIG fonts'In-reply-to': Burton.pa''s message of 10 Apr 84 11':31 PST'To': LispSupport.pa, Burton''To fix this, DEdit would have to move alreday printed material when there is a change of font on a line. I suggest that the big fonts should be better matched, as this would probably look lousy anyway, even if done right by DEdit.''But the bug is real': Priority': Perhaps; Diff': Hard.''Beau'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
