It almost seems that 'LISPCORE^ isn''t even considering the possibility of a user wanting'to list a file not made with MAKEFILE.

However, I''m not aware of bugs even in the <Lisp>Library>'version which would cause the behaviour you describe.''Finally, what sysout were you using?  There has been a bug (for years?) in'the lisp function GETFILEMAP, which I fixed on about March 11, 1984; the'manifestation of this bug would be an error of some sort when you tried'to listfiles of certain peculiar non-Lisp files.''If this keeps happening to you, but not to me, then I can understand why'you are "sick and tired" . . .  maybe there is a ROACHFLG in the system'that adds additional bugs when a ROACH is running?''-----''Date':  3 Apr 84 20':34 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': AR 333': LISTFILES should try to list non-Interlisp files'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 28 Mar 84 08':53':03 PST (Wednesday)'To': LispSupport.pa, Roach''Is this a problem with standard LISTFILES, or a problem when you have SINGLEFILEINDEX loaded?''If the latter, then this AR should be passed off to JonL.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 13-Apr-84 14':42':09Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: '[Date': 12 Apr 84 23':51 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': AR 333'This AR is closed, as far as I''m concerned.
