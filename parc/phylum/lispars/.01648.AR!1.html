Let''s assume that these have been analyzed by MasterScope.  Let''s set the goal of renaming A to ANEW and B to BNEW.  If you rename B to BNEW and then A to ANEW, everything''s fine.  However, if you do them in the opposite order, when you try to rename B to BNEW, changefn (or whomever) tries to find A (instead of correctly trying to find ANEW) to change the old call to B.  ReAnalyzing A after renaming it will correct this, but MasterScope should do this itself.''-- Jeff''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: MasterscopeMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
