Because Lisp uses ASCII and NS printers use the NS character set, we have to do some character conversions.''	These conversions are needed at 3 places in the INTERPRESS code; the Fugue.6 release as of now has it in one of the three.''	{Phylum}<Lispcore>Sources>INTERPRESS[.dcom] has all of the conversions in place.  I was able to run listings, and the characters appeared everywhere they should.  This code could be imported into the release, if the demand is great enough; it does not affect other parts of the system.''Ron--''	I changed everything but APPENDIDENTIFIER.IP to do the conversion to NS charsets.  Unfortunately, things like font names, e.g., "XEROX XC82-0-0 TERMINAL" want the hyphens to be ASCII hyphens!  Since APPENDIDENTIFIER is the guy who emits those, I changed it to do no conversions.  IP.PRIN3 et al noe CONVERT TO NS.  There is also a function, NCHARS.IP, which returns the # of chars in the NS version of the string.'-----'Date': Wed, 14 Mar 84 12':38 PST'From': Raim.pasa'Subject': Re': More on "Terminal"-font problems'In-reply-to': "Sybalsky.pa''s message of 14 Mar 84 11':18 PST"'To': Sybalsky.pa'cc': MASINTER.pa, Raim, Phillips, Sannella.pa, Kaplan.pa''John,''Thank you for your thorough analysis of the problem.  There are only a few sites that care about this problem, but they are up-in-arms over it.  Your solution is timely.  However, Terminal only exists in two sizes, 8 and 12, I believe.  Can customers function with just these until we order 6 and 10?  I''d rather not risk adding new Interpress.dcom unless the payoff is real.''--Marty'-----'Date': 14 Mar 84 13':09 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': More on "Terminal"-font problems'In-reply-to': Raim.pasa''s message of Wed, 14 Mar 84 12':38 PST'To': Raim.pasa'cc': Sybalsky.pa, MASINTER.pa, Phillips.pasa, Sannella.pa, Kaplan.pa''You''re the one who knows what the customers can live with; however, let''s look at the possible needs':''--TEditing a document with Gacha 10 in it will print with modern in place of gacha;  We could (kludge, kludge) put code in INTERPRESS to coerce Gacha into Terminal, and probably change 10-pt to whichever would be best.
