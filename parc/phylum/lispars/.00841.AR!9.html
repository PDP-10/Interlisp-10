TEdit uses the normal host-selection mechanisms of Lisp.  My impression was that Beau had set DEFAULTPRINTHOST (note the name!).''"...I am now convinced this is a TEdit problem, since hardcopy of windows and LISTFILES seems to go properly to DEFAULTPRINTINGHOST."  Did you try TEdit as well?''-----''Date':  9 May 84 19':21 PDT'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': hardcopy problem'In-reply-to': Sybalsky.pa''s message of 9 May 84 18':56 PDT'To': Sybalsky.pa'cc': Masinter.pa, TEditSupport.pa, Kaplan.pa''John':''As I have already told you via separate msg, the DEFAULTPRINTHOST was a typo in my message, and was not the cause of the problem.''Note that the problem is a little more specifc than Larry''s msg suggests. Redirection seems to works fine among Pup printers. The problem was when DPH was set to a single, NS print server in a foreign domain (something like, XSIS-HQ':Independence) that the TEdit hardcopy went to LispPrint anyway.''Beau' '-----''Date': 10 May 84 10':24 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': hardcopy problem'In-reply-to': Sybalsky.pa''s message of 9 May 84 18':56 PDT'To': Sybalsky.pa'cc': Masinter.pa, TEditSupport.pa, Sheil.pa, Kaplan.pa''Yes, I did try Hardcopy from TEDIT and yes it failed.
