This creates a problem with SINGLEFILEINDEX as the index may start on the reverse of the last page of listing.  I therefore ``wish" for an option which would force SINGLEFILEINDEX to insert a blank page if necessary, in order that the index start on an odd-numbered page.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-Aug-84 12':19':28Attn: Kaplan, JonlAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
