I am getting lots of similar, intermittant errors when I try to manipulate phylum files.''-------'Date': 12 Jul 84 14':45 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''I have identified one case where Lafite will inappropriately generate file busy errors (can happen if you logout without having done an Update).  Have you experienced file busy errors outside of Lafite in cases where you believe you shouldn''t have gotten them, i.e., neither you nor anyone else had the file open for read that you wanted to write, or were writing the file you wanted to read?''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 12-Jul-84 14':48':59</pre>
