Number: 1033Date:  8-May-84 17':23':11Submitter: SybalskySource: SybalskySubject: First-left, Left, and Right margins being set to -85Lisp Version:  7-May-84 16':18':26Description: Somewhere in the game, TEdit is setting all the margins in the DEFAULT paragraph looks to be -85.  The effect is that any TEdit started after that will never display any text.  Actually, it''s all being displayed single-character wide off the left edge of the window.Workaround: INSPECT TEDIT.DEFAULT.FMTSPEC, and change the three margin values to zero.  TEdits which start after that should work right.Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':41':22Attn: Assigned To: SybalskyIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
