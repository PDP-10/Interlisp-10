However, it is still the case that the Installation Utility (which is Prometheus+script) uses the old style of installation. This is serious because the virtual memory is not allocated in a way that avoids bad pages, which can lead to serious problems running Interlisp on disks with bad spots.''Date': 26 Mar 84 17':42 PST'From': masinter.pa''This AR would be obsoleted by AR#379''-----''Date':  4 May 84 12':45 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': ARS 135 AND 793'In-reply-to': JFung.pasa''s message of 4 May 84 09':01':12 PDT (Friday)'To': JFung.pasa'cc': Masinter.pa, LispSupport.pa, Sheil.pa''Jerry,''If you need the sources for prometheus, they are obtainable.
