STRPOS will then have two more (optional) arguments -- one to permit CASEARRAY shiftings, and another, BACKWARDSFLG, to permit searching in backwards order.''Note that after discussion, it was decided to drop the CASEARRAY argument to STRPOSL; current proposed definitions are on BSEARCH&lt;LispCore&gt;Library&gt; rather than from &lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt;.  BFILEPOS would remain in the BSEARCH library package.''Any complications?''-- JonL --''-----''Date':  1 May 84 08':27 PDT'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': Extensions to STRPOS, STRPOSL'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 30 Apr 84 20':21 PDT'To': JonL.pa'cc': LispCore&uarr;.pa''A short procedural point': if you are going to put it in this release, the sooner the better.

Are there some parts of the system that use this?''-----''Date':  1 May 84 12':48 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Extensions to STRPOS, STRPOSL'In-reply-to': masinter.pa''s message of 1 May 84 11':36 PDT'To': masinter.pa'cc': LispCore&uarr;.pa''I have asked for the CASEARRAY arg for Lafite''s searching commands, I think Tedit wants it for its Find command, and I periodically run into places that kludge around its nonexistence.  It''s a natural extension to STRPOS along the lines that FILEPOS has had for ages and ALPHORDER recently obtained.  So it seems amply justified to go into the system; I encouraged JonL to do so.  (The BACKWARDSFLG is less justified, but it doesn''t bother me particularly.)''	Bill''-----''Date':  1 May 84 13':51 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Extensions to STRPOS, STRPOSL'In-reply-to': masinter.pa''s message of 1 May 84 11':36 PDT'To': masinter.pa'cc': JonL.pa, LispCore&uarr;.pa''Motivation is that parts of the system want to use it.  Several packages I have (including RS232) are currently doing a FILESLOAD of BSEARCH (in the case that (STRPOS "foo" "FOO") is NIL), and Bill has some proposals for Lafite that are pending this installation.''BFILEPOS, while a nice complement to FILEPOS, doesn''t have any system clients yet, so it''s staying in the BSEARCH library package.''-----''Date':  1 May 84 16':15 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Extensions to STRPOS, STRPOSL'In-reply-to': Burton.pa''s message of 1 May 84 08':27 PDT'To': Burton.pa'cc': JonL.pa, LispCore&uarr;.pa''Ok, I moved them into IOCHAR now; will start a loadup tonite.'''---------------------------''Date':  2 May 84 00':57 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': New loadup with extended STRPOS, STRPOSL'To': LispCore&uarr;.pa''cc': JonL.pa''Latest sysouts on &lt;LispCore&gt;Next&gt; have the new versions of STRPOS and STRPOSL, along with a few other changes the Greg made, and that I made, this evening.  ''By the bye, looks like the casearray argument for STRPOS goes a long way back (actually, I wanted it shortly after starting the RS232CHAT code too)''     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----''Date':  6 Jul 83 15':32 PDT'From': Yonke.pa'Subject': a case-array for STRPOS'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Yonke.pa'Lisp-System-Date': 28-JUN-83 19':31':02''I propose we add another arg to STRPOS which will be a case-array (similar to the arg to FILEPOS).  Also, in addition I would like to see the arg be able to have the value T in which case the case array would be one that mapped alphabetic characters the same independent of case (this might eliminate the proliferation of case arrays).''Martin'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 18':41':16</pre>
