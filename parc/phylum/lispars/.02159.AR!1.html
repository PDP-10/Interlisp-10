I''m looking for a package that will allow me to combine parameters and commands in a single window/menu.  Thanks."''The Tedit expanded menu is just a Tedit document.  The command "buttons" are image objects with special image functions.   The code used to implement the expanded menu is all in the file TEDITMENU, one of the tedit source files.''I personally (Sannella) have used the functions in this package to implement a "form" with parameters and commands.  However, it was not easy, and I was glad that I had the Tedit implementers around to talk to.  If you want, you can try looking at the code in TEDITMENU, and use the functions there, but be careful -- you will probably have to grovel around with low level functions.  Also, there is no guarantee that the functions in this file will not be changed.  Sooner or later, this package will be cleaned up, documented, and released so other people can use it.''[John -- I have supmitted AR xxx': Cleanup, Document, Release TEDITMENU functionality]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
