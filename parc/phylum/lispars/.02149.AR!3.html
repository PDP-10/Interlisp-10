NONLEAFHOSTS is a list of hosts asserted to permanently lack a leaf server.  If Lisp fails to connect to a Leaf server on a given host, or even gets back a "no such socket" error, the condition could merely be transient, so it is correct for Lisp to try again later.''One might argue that Lisp should at least wait a while before trying again, so I''ll change the ar to be that': "When no Leaf server found on host, don''t immediately try again".''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 15-Sep-84 14':01':03</pre>
