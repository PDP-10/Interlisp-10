It would be nice'if LOAD & READ used the same readtable.  Perhaps FILERDTBL could'be dispensed with altogether?  I think the following setup is'a reasonable proposal for the way all the system readtables should'look at loadup':'	CHAR	CODE	SYNTAX'	seprs	0-32	SEPRCHAR'	"	34	STRINGDELIM'	%	37	ESCAPE'	''	39	(MACRO FIRST NONIMMEDIATE ESCQUOTE READ%'')'	(	40	LEFTPAREN'	)	41	RIGHTPAREN'	[	91	LEFTBRACKET'	]	93	RIGHTBRACKET'Sort of a compromise between \PRIMREADTABLE and FILERDTBL.'\SYSREADTABLE and EDITRDTBL would also start this way.  (I also'have uses for backquote, comma, & vertical bar, but these are'separate proposals.)'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: roach.PAEdit-Date:  4-Apr-84  9':57':50Attn: Kaplan.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Read and PrintMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: UnlikelyStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
