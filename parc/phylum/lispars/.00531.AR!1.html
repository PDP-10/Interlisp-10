It''s real deceiving.  I used up 5 sheets of paper before I got the tabs close to the way I wanted and that was pure luck.  Without a hardcopy mode formatting is difficult and very time consuming.''Mimi'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sybalsky.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
