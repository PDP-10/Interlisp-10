Naturally, I want to restart my connection.  If I middle button the CHAT window, I get the standard menu rather than a RECONNECT menu.  If I button CLOSE in the standard menu, nothing happens.  The only way to reconnect is to close my CHAT window, button CHAT in the background menu, select my host, etc.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':45':02
