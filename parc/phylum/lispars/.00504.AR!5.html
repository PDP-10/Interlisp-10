Therefore, Adobe doesn''t generate "accelerator files" for the source field, so you can''t query (or sort) by the contents of this field.''This was set in rock (i.e. programs) when the LispAR form was first set up, and the chance that it will be changed is nil.  I agree, it was a mistake.  For now, the only thing I would suggest is to hack something using the functions in AREDIT to generate a list of the ARs containing ROACH in the source field (using case-independent comparisons).''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 14':49':14</pre>
