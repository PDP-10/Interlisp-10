The main difficulty is that input from the keyboard is limited to 8-bit characters only, and that leaves no extra characters left over if MetaShift is on (e.g., if you enable MetaShift, then Top-Blank and Meta-A are indistinguishable).'''The workaround for your immediate problem is  ''(TEDIT.SETSYNTAX 200Q ''NEXT)''Also, if you happen to like Top-Blank being the Tedit Undo key (I don''t), you should also''(TEDIT.SETSYNTAX 0 ''UNDO)'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 11':54':55
