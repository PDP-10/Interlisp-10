One is offset from the other by about 3/4" of an inch.  This is rather disconcerting to the user, and field service has to do some tweaking to get the system usable (reduce the width of the screen, and balance the offset).''-------''From': Trow.pa'Subject': Re': Smalltalk vs. Lisp on Phillips display'In-reply-to': "Martin.pasa''s message of 24 Feb 84 10':11 PST"'To': Martin.pasa'cc': VanOrden.pasa, VanMelle, Trow, 1100Support.pasa''Horizontal sync timing and blanking timing are determined by HRam parameters set in DisplayInit.mc.  The only copy of DisplayInit.mc I can find on [Phylum]<Lispcore>* is in <Lispcore>uCode>AltoMC.dm.  It is dated 3 June 1982 which is at least two releases out of date.  It does not have the current standard parameters.  If this is really the right source code, the parameters should be changed to agree with the code on [Indigo]<D0Source>AMesaSources.dm and reassembled.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: le.pasaEdit-Date: 19-Apr-84  1':21':54
