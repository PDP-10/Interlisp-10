TYPES is an atom or list of types (either names or numbers).  If PAGETHRESHOLD is given, then STORAGE only lists statistics for types that have at least PAGETHRESHOLD pages allocated to them.''- - -'I just noticed that this is completely incompatible with Interlisp-10''s STORAGE, which also takes two optional args which have no meaning for Interlisp-D.  The manual notes that the printout from STORAGE is implementation-dependent, so it might also note that the arguments are also implementation-dependent.  And to the above blurb might be added''[Interlisp-10 users': note that these optional arguments are implementation-dependent and different from the optional arguments to Interlisp-10''s STORAGE].''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 17':34':33
