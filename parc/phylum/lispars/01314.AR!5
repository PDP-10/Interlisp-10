OPENFILE({FLOPPY}abc OUTPUT EXACT) still adds a version number. If you fix it *not* to add a version number, we''ll change the spec to allow "EXACT" to be a recognition mode in which only a character-for-character exact match is allowed, but that most devices won''t know about it initially.]'["Masinter" "11-Sep-84 17':28':33" Subject': Attn': Disposition':]'["Masinter" "11-Sep-84 17':46':29" Subject':]Description: 'When a file is written to {FLOPPY} in LISP,  a version number is automatically supplied for the filename.  Since PILOT does not support version numbers,  the file cannot be read from floppy in the MESA environment.  This means that users cannot write  a new Prometheus.script  to floppy  within LISP.
