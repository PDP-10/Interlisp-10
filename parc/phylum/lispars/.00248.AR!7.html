That document unfortunately is out of date. One of the ways it is out of date is that it doesn''t mention "streams".  It is pretty clear that FULLNAME is a unique handle on the open stream. One of the "file assumptions" we are breaking is that we are allowing FULLNAME to be a non-Literal Atom.''One way to couch these design discussions would be to come up with a revision to the appropriate section of the VM; that is a reasonably formal specification which spells out the way in which the pieces interact with each other. ''(I''m retrieving the VM document from archive.)''-----''Date': 26 Mar 84 15':31 PST'From': masinter.pa''The sources for the Virtual Machine specification are currently on [maxc]&lt;Netlisp&gt;. The vm.partN files are more up to date. I think that some of the VM documentation could form the kernel for a more formal description of what Interlisp does internally (e.g., the exact specification of what FULLNAME does and its invariants is not a good subject for the Interlisp Reference Manual but would be a good subject for the VM document).''''Date': 22 MAR 84 13':29 PST'Subject': Files retrieved from archive''&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PUB;1'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART8;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART7;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART6;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART5;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART4;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART3;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART2;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'&lt;NETLISP&gt;VM.PART1;1   not retrieved - file already exists on disk'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 17':36':49Attn: DocumentationAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: DocumentationSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
