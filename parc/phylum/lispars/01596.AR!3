Loading Carol sysout into Lisp Volume (42MB Carol Partitioned --2 Lisp volumes, 1 diagnostics and the rest for Hard Disk device {DSK})'	'	2.  Start Lisp, Create {DSK}, MAKESYS to Floppy.(SYS#1)'	'	3.  Load SYS#1 into 42MB Fugue6 partitioned disk-- 3 Lisp volumes, 1 diagnostics and 1 BOOT Lisp.'	'	4.  MAKESYS to Floppy (SYS#2).  Load SYS#2 into 42MB Carol Partitioned --2 Lisp volumes, 1 diagnostics and the rest for Hard Disk device {DSK}'	'	5.  Start Lisp , immediately drop into 9915.  Hit Stop key, MP shows 1108,'	no cursor, machine freezes.'	'NOTE': REpeat step 1-5.  At step 3 instead of load SYS#1  into 42MB Fugue6 partitioned disk-- 3 Lisp volumes, 1 diagnostics and 1 BOOT Lisp, I loaded into 42MB Carol Partitioned-- 3 Lisp volumes, 1 diagnostics and a small {DSK}.  Everything seems OK.  Nothing has happened.  I can work fine in Lisp.''Thu''-----''Date':  9 Jul 84 16':21 PDT'From': Stansbury.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1596'In-reply-to': Le.pasa''s message of 9 Jul 84 18':14':56 PDT (Monday)'To': Le.pasa'cc': Sannella.pa, Stansbury.pa''This seems pretty weird.''One point you might want to know, and pass on to customers who have similar problems': if you fall into some maintenance panel error, don''t just hit the Stop key.  That used to work, but sometimes it doesn''t now; it can cause your system to freeze, as you found.  Instead, you should hit the Undo key and then hit control-D.  This does not have the tendency to freeze the system.''Another point': If the machine stops with a 9915 (or most anything else), you can usually teleraid it.  If you don''t know how to do this, find someone to teach you how.  For this particular problem, if you had teleraided the machine in step 5, you could have found out things like what function the machine died in, which would give us a lot of useful clues in tracking down the bug.''Thanks for finding this.  If we find out anything, we''ll keep you informed; also please tell us if you can find out anything more about this bug or find a simpler protocol that will cause it.''-- Tayloe.''-----''Date': 10 Jul 84 22':56':32 PDT (Tuesday)'From': le.pasa'Subject': Re': AR#1596'In-reply-to': Stansbury.pa''s message of 9 Jul 84 16':21 PDT'To': Stansbury.pa'cc': Le, Sannella.pa''Tayloe,''I also tried Undo and ^D to see if I can track down the bug, but there seems to have no affect on the system.  The only key that allows me to get back to 1108 MP code is UNDO.  The problem seems pretty strange, I agreed.   I will try to see if I can teleraid the machine in step 5.
