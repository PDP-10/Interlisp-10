I didn''t used to be asked these questions, so I assume the Jun-20 edit has something to do with this.  I''m very much against this sort of user prompting.  All Interlisp functions that don''t absolutely require user intervention (e.g. inserting a floppy into drive) should be able be capable of being fully programmatic without ASKUSER/DWIMWAIT type interfaces.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: StefikEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 17':07':25
