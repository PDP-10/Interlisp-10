These display as black rectangles, and lafite doesn''t parse the header fields very well.  When I move such a message to a mail file residing on IVY, the line feeds remain.''This is certainly not a pressing problem....''--Tom'-----'Date': 14 Mar 84 19':26 PST'From': masinter.pa'Subject': AR#62'To': LispSupport''This is a BUG not a WISH. Maybe Tom wishes it were fixed, but it is really a bug. ''The "black boxes" are line-feeds. This turns into two other ARs': LineFeed  should have separate graphic in Tedit and fonts (e.g., a tiny &lt;lf&gt;).''Second AR, TEdit should allow one to edit files which have EOL convention CR-LF as well as CR.''If this isn''t the case, then Lafite should open its mail folder in Binary, rather than Text.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 11-Apr-84 16':39':50</pre>
