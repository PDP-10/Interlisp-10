I suggest an equivalent READPRINTERPORT and WRITEPRINTERPORT. I don''t like it that the cable is different, unless we also supply an adapter cable. I would prefer to manufacture as many cables as there are new CP boards and just install it as part of the field upgrade. So':''Lisp AR is to create the microcode and document it; action item for manufacturing and field support is to cut in the cable that brings it out to the back of the machine and to produce the adapters.''-----''Date': 22 AUG 84 22':02 PDT'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': AR#1776 parallel port'To':   lispsupport'cc':   charnley, purcell, herring''This is DLion microcode, not communication.

So they have been subsumed there.  At that point I doubled up the documentation to cover the Dolphin as well.  The Dolphin hardware manual has some more stuff, that would not be of much use to anyone wanting to use the printer port for a "user device".)''-----''currently, doc. is on {eris}<Herring>harmony>Printerport.tedit'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 25-Sep-84 12':04':46
