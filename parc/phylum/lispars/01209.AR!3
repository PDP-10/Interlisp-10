Should I connect or should I abort?'Workaround: Subject': AR#1209, Jose Luu, "File package forgets device name"'To': Le.pasa'cc': , Masinter''I suspect this is a bug in the SAMEDIR package rather the file package. I will check it out, but he should probably not run with/load SAMEDIR as a "workaround".Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date:  7-Jun-84 16':01':37Attn: Kaplan, MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: OnceImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
