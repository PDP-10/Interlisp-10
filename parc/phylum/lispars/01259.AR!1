I then said'. ANALYZE ON MO44IO'to which someone responded'=MOD44IO''Fine, I thought, but then Masterscope proceeded to print "Can''t analyze x" for all functions on the file.  It did the same thereafter even when I correctly spelled MOD44IO.''A little investigation revealed that MSFILELST contained ((MOD44IO . MO44IOCOMS)), i.e., the misspelled version of MOD44IO packed with COMS instead of the correct spelling.  Naturally, INFILECOMS? failed on the misspelled coms.  Setting MSFILELST to NIL cured the problem.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 30-May-84 15':24':12Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: MasterscopeMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: OnceImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
