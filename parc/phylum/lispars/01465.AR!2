The current behavior suggests that the tests'for these modes are (KEYDOWNP ''CONTROL) etc; since the LOCK key is a different'physical key, holding it down does not get stacked menu selection.  This'is in Fugue.6).  (I haven''t checked that it''s still true, but in Fugue.4'it was also the case that SHIFT selection was really ''left-shift-key'' selection.)'Given the redefinable nature of the keyboard, both of these really ought to be'"in shift mode" or "in control mode", which check the internal flags set by'the keyboard interpreter.'	Darrel'-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 14':48':49Attn: Sheil, SybalskyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: KeyboardMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
