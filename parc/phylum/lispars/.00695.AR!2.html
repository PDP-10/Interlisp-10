There is a whole'lisp enviroment of information relevant to the EXEC process, and'picking out just the connected directory to be displayed in the EXEC'window''s title is an arbitrary choice.  Jellinek can certainly ADVISE'/CNDIR if he wants.  The &lt;LISPUSERS&gt;SYSTAT package will also display 'this information.  Finally, Jellinek''s suggestion doesn''t fit well in'an environment in which there may be more than one EXEC window, such as'provided by &lt;LISP&gt;LIBRARY&gt;EXEC package.'				Kelly'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Apr-84 18':04':06Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
