Internet communication between machines could be better and the EVALSERVER package seems to be a good first try at achieving the communication prerequisite to solving AR361.  Just the same,  using FLOPPY.FROM.FILE &amp; FLOPPY.TO.FILE isn''t all that bad.  If the objective is just to copy a floppy once in a while, eat a longer lunch.  If the idea is to once in while make multiple copies of a master floppy, putting the floppy image on a file server using FLOPPY.TO.FILE so that multiple 1108s can access this file using FLOPPY.FROM.FILE seems to be quite reasonable.  Users actually in the business of copying floppies would probably use mechanical copiers instead of 1108s.  Though AR361 is legitimate, it is really too heavy an investment to make to correct the problem in the absence of evalserver-like tools in the language and even if the tools were available, the problem wouldn''t become easy.
