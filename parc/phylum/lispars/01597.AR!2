It would be'nice if the directory functions for the 1108 local file system (Carol'rel. 20-Jun-84) would sort the files it returns.  Currently when you do'a DIR files which only vary by their version number come out in'different places in the list, etc.  This makes it very hard to compare'files.  ''Thanks,'Martin''--------''2) When doing a DIR of {DSK} and you have several name heirarchies it will list'   them jumbled up according to the order they were written disregarding the'   ''directory'' name.  For example it would list':''	{DSK}<FOO>'    FILEA.;1''	{DSK}<FOO>BAR>'    FILEB.;1''	{DSK}<FOO>'    FILEC.;1''    where I would like it to look like':''	{DSK}<FOO>'    FILEA.;1'    FILEC.;1''	{DSK}<FOO>BAR>'    FILEB.;1''-----''Date':  9 Jul 84 13':57 PDT'From': Stansbury.pa'Subject': Re': DIR on 1108 local file system'In-reply-to': Le.pasa''s message of 9 Jul 84 17':08':50 PDT (Monday)'To': Le.pasa'cc': STansbury.pa, Sannella.pa''Yup, it would be nice if the directory enumeration code sorted files properly, but I seriously doubt this will be done for Harmony, for 2 reasons':'a) it is tricky, and I have no time to devote to it before AAAI; and 'b) eventually we will be ripping out the directory code and replacing it with MFile directories -- if that happens soon, it would not make any sense to make a major change to the current directory code.''-- Tayloe.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Jul-84 14':28':38Attn: StansburyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
