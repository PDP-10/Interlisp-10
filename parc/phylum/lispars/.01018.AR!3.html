I had done a Get on an AR, and a while later went to put a new number in the Number': slot of the menu, but couldn''t get any response.  There was still an AR.FORM.MENU process, and it seemed to have the tty, and its backtrace showed it in Tedit''s \WAITFORSYSBUFP idle loop.''-----''Date':  9 May 84 12':08 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': more on catatonic AR.FORM'To': Sannella''You can get into this state quite easily (at least with the Tedit of May 1) if, after calling AR.FORM the first operation you do is to click NEW.  You will get a new form (same as what''s showing, of course), and thereafter the menu does not respond to NUMBER':.'''-----''Date': 10 May 84 09':50 PDT'From': Sannella.pa'Subject': Re': more on catatonic AR.FORM'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 9 May 84 12':08 PDT'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': Sannella.pa''This seems to work alright with the latest AREDIT and TEDIT.''I suspect that it was a Tedit problem --- I was able to reproduce the problem with an older Tedit.  I think that what may have been happening was not that AR menu was catatonic, but just that the menu buttons were not reverse-video-ing when selected.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 22-May-84 10':45':18</pre>
