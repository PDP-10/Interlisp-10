To reproduce it try the following':''Type in a paragraph of  text (half a dozen lines with NO newlines ending in mid-line) followed by two newlines followed by six words and another newline.  The three words should now be seperated from the paragraph by one blank line.  Select the paragraph using the middle button , justify it and indent it (first and other lines) by 3.0 .  Move the caret to the start of the document by selecting the first lines.  Then shift/select the line containing the three words.  This should copy the three words, unindented, before the paragraph.  To get the error "Moving Text down after DEL.; -113 ERROR" just press backspace and wait five seconds.''If you don''t get the error try again.  I got it four times out of five - which I think justifies the EVERYTIME.''The number in the error message varies.  I have had -113, -68 and two others I didn''t note.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-Aug-84 12':25':18Attn: Sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
