The icons Lafite uses are fairly large and a number of them burn up a good deal of screen space. So I find it convenient to overlap them. However, the distinguishing info is in the name of the folder, which is in the middle of the icon.''Suggestion': Put the name high in the icon so that each one only uses a small amount of space when overlapped vertically (like a file cabinet viewed from out front. You might even put the folder name on the tab (make it a "full cut" tab) and the word "Mail" down in the center of the icon.''Thanks,''Austin''-------'Date': 25 May 84 17':22 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''Hmm, not sure what the best thing to do about this is.  True, the icons don''t overlap very well, but you need an icon that potentially has space for a long name.  I also note that Tedit icons have the same problem.   I''m not much of an artist; if you would like to submit an icon that satisfies the constraint above (so it won''t choke too badly if you happened to be browsing {Indigo}&lt;Services&gt;AutoRepairs), I would be happy to consider it.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 30-May-84 15':12':13Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
