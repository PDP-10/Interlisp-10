Number: 629Date: 10-Apr-84 16':29':45Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Raim.pasaSubject: Dolphin/Dorado {DSK} should support file typesLisp Version: Description: 'Date': Tue, 10 Apr 84 13':10 PST'From': Raim.pasa'Subject': Re': Ar #561'In-reply-to': "vanMelle.pa''s message of 9 Apr 84 16':56 PST"'To': vanMelle.pa, Sannella.PA,'cc': le, LispSupport.pa, 1100Support''Bill,''Thank you for your clarification.''Our testing indicates that Floppy code does not support  the TYPE attribute.  I.e., when we copy {dsk}foo.dcom to {floppy}foo.dcom, no type information is maintained.  When a customer attempts to take his distribution floppy and copy {floppy}foo.dcom to {fileserver}foo.dcom, type TEXT is the default.''The upshot seems to be that 1108 customers can''t routinely create &lt;lispusers&gt; and &lt;lisplibrary&gt; on their fileservers.  Is their a workaround?  I seem to recall an undocumented variable called DEFAULTFILETYPE.  Would setting it to BINARY for *.dcom and *.sysout files be a suitable workaround for customers to know about?'...'-----''Date': 10 Apr 84 14':23 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Ar #561'In-reply-to': Raim.pasa''s message of Tue, 10 Apr 84 13':10 PST'To': Raim.pasa'cc': vanMelle.pa, Sannella.PA, le.pasa, LispSupport.pa, 1100Support.pasa''Yes, setting DEFAULTFILETYPE to BINARY during COPYFILE of binary files is the workaround.
