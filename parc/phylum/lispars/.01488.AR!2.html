I often hit the TAB key during this time (as a request to make the menu "snuggle-up").  The result, of course, is that when Dedit finishes pretty-printing, it treats the TAB as an input key and wipes out the buffer.  ''This is easy to work around (use the POP option in the menu), but it is annoying.''--Tom''-----''Date': 24 Jun 84 17':19 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Dedit': TAB while Dedit is pretty-printing in Edit buffer wipes out edit buffer'In-reply-to': Dietterich.pa''s message of 22 Jun 84 10':33 PDT'To': Dietterich.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa, Sheil.pa''I also find that when I take the obvious workaround (the POP command), that the underlining scheme is confused as to which form is "first" -- often both the item in the edit buffer and the last selected item in the workspace are bold-underlined.''At one time, Beau may have diagnosed this as a poor interaction in the read loop due to the infamous PEEKC bug; but now that Bill has fixed this nemesis, perhaps it''s time for DEdit to catch up?''-- JonL --'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 26-Jun-84 11':14':07Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
