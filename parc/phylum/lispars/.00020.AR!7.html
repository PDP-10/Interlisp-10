Then another break window came up (for no good reason) which just said "PROG break1".  Shortly after that, the machine went into an infinite loop of bringing up new break windows (overlaying each other); it was trying to print out some message to a displaystream for which WFROMDS wanted to create a WINDOW (looping around again because of some error).''The mouse and interrupts were completely dead  during this ballet of break windows.  Finally a stack overflow afforded me the opportunity to HARDRESET several times (the first time didn''t do it!).''At least the phony break windows were partiallyh overlapping the background, so they could be disposed by':'  (while (WHICHW) do (CLOSEW (WHICHW)))'----'Subject': AR#20 revert to PROG'date': 27-jun-84'To': Jonl''I couldn''t reproduce this.  The break window that came up saying "PROG break': 1" is the window for the reverted break and is normal.''I don''t know where the infinite loop of other windows came from.
