''I don''t know why LOADFROM of a file requires ROOTFILENAME to work that way, especially since I was loading the file from a Tenex.

Of course, an 'additional optional argument would be added to the user-level functions so 'that the automatic default could be overrided with an explicit OS name.'''Amongst the other kinds of problems it would solve are the automatic'uppercasification of file names (some file systems are case-sensitive, and'others alledgedly aren''t); and possibly the EXACT feature wanted by Gumby'and Roach.'''Whether or not I could work on this problem is dependent on the priority of'the other items on my queue.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-Apr-84 15':55':04Attn: LispAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
