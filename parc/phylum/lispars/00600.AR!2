A corresponding Demo.sysout will be placed there shortly.  The significant differences between these sysouts and the previous release to {phylum}<Lisp>Current> are the following':''++ Change for Interpress users':  Some Interpress fonts, such as "Terminal", have some characters at non-standard character numbers.  As a result, certain characters (hyphen, dollar, uparrow, leftarrow) would not print in these fonts.  The Interpress software has been changed to map these characters appropriately when using Interpress fonts.''++ New 1108 Floppy disk code':  The floppy disk code has been substantially improved.  A bug that caused sysouts to floppy to contain bad pages has been fixed.  The current documentation is in {phylum}<lisp>current>floppy.tty.''++ New 1108 microcode has been included in the sysouts, fixing an obscure bug that caused MP code 9915''s.''++ A bug that caused DOSTATS to break with a hash overflow error has been fixed.''++ The precision of transcendental functions has been improved.''-----''Sender': Sannella.PA'Date':  9 Apr 84 14':39':56 PST (Monday)'From': LispSupport.pa'Subject': New Release of Interlisp-D  -- bug!'To': LispUsers^.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''I regret to report that the new release that was announced this morning has a serious bug --- the interpreted versions of FTIMES and FPLUS were not included.  Note that this does not affect the compilation of FTIMES --- indeed, this is why it was so hard to catch this bug.''At this moment, a new set of sysouts is being created, which will be put on {phylum}<lisp>current> as soon as possible.''If you have already retrieved the new sysout from this morning, the problem can be fixed by loading the patch file {phylum}<lisp>current>FPPATCH.DCOM.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 11-Apr-84 16':59':35Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: Status: FixedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
