Because the only way to right-button the window is by doing it in the title bar, and the title bar of the bottom window overlaps the horiz scroll region of the browser, so half the time I mistakenly start scrolling the browser sideways... this is much easier to demonstrate than to explain.''			Herb'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
