ROSEBOWL didn''t respond for the font I requested and the leaf server brought up the window with the ABORT button.  At this point I became stuck.  I couldn''t use the ABORT button because MOUSE process wasn''t watching buttons - it was running TEdit''s FONTCREATE and therefore waiting for the leaf.''The ABORT window didn''t seem to time out as it usually does.  I don''t known whether this was a coincidence or whether timeout handling is connected with the MOUSE process in some way.''I eventually managed to get out by creating a break window using control/B and issuing a (SPAWN.MOUSE).  This allowed me to create a PSW and eventually to kill the old MOUSE.  Nothing else, including control/D, seemed to work.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':27':41</pre>
