For a user in Pasadena, {Phylex':} is not an adequate description of the file server Phylex':XSIS North.  The name of a device should not be dependent on the current setting of the Domain default, any more than we should omit the device or directory field from a file''s full name just because you happened to be connected to it at the moment.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 23-Apr-84 15':25':56Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: NS ProtocolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
