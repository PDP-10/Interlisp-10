Thus, there is nothing in it to GETPUPSTRING on.

Thus there is no reason for GETPUPSTRING to do anything reasonable.''The second comment says I fixed it to not error.  When I fix something, it doesn''t instantaneously appear.  You won''t see the fix until the Harmony release.''A more generic comment': the low level ethernet code is not designed to be simple to use by network (or Lisp) neophytes, and there is no good reason to expend effort to make it so.  I will, however, update the documentation to make explicit the need to fill in the pup header.''	Bill]''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 11':18':31</pre>
