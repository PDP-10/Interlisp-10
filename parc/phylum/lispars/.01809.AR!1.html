The function computes the day of the week internally (in order to compute daylightsavingsp), but does not produce it; it could easily be modified to do so.''Seems like a tiny bit of cleaning up on this would produce a reasonable user-accessible function.''	Bill''     ----- End Forwarded Messages -----'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: LispAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
