The lower and left edges behave correctly in this respect.  However, the upper and right edges move downwards/leftwards one pixel when they are not adjacent to the corner being moved.  It looks like a simple arithmetic error.  The error could be local to the reshape function or deeper in some region aquisition function.  The effect is barely noticeable and not very annoying if a window is only reshaped once.  However, if any corner other than the top/right has to be moved several times, the cumulative effect is very annoying.'--------'Date': 28 Aug 84 18':32 PDT'From': burton.pa'Subject': ar 1702': "fixed" edges moving'To': Le.pasa'cc': bird.pasa, burton.pa''I could not duplicate this.  After many (10) moves via middle button, the opposite corner of the window was still in the same place on the screen. This was true moving any of the four corners.  The reshaping code did get changed earlier this summer and it is possible that this got fixed in that process.  Let me know if it is still there in the latest loadups.''richard'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: burton.paEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 18':34':09
