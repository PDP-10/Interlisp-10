The volume file map is a b-tree which maps file IDs onto disk pages.  This code was convoluted, undocumented, full of bugs, and incompatible with Pilot 10.0.  It had to be entirely rewritten; the result is VolumeFileMap.dcom, which seems to work fine and is fully compatible with Mesa 10.0.  -- Tayloe StansburyWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':22':29Attn: Assigned To: stansburyIn/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 3071File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
