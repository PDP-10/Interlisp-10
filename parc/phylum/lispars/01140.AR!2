This information is only flashed up on the screen briefly after you have issued confirmation.  This is the opposite of the usual order of confirmation requests and volume information in INSTALLLISPTOOL. The order which obtains in other cases is clearly the correct one.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Le.pasaEdit-Date: 21-Jun-84  7':50':33Attn: jfung.pasaAssigned To: In/By: 20-June-84Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: 1108Disk: Q2040 (43MB)Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 8191File Server: IFSServer Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: FixedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
