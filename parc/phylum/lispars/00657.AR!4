It is a non-feature of the Interlisp-10 compiler only. I changed the problem type to Documentation, to edit where it talks about DECLARE in the manual to clear this up.]System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: DWIMMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: 42,1Memory Size: 6000File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
