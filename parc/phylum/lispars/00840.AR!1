Given the absolutely brain-damaged implementation of file pointers in Interlisp, it seems that COPYBYTES ought to make some effort to handle this case gracefully.  Copying parts of file onto other parts of the same file is a very common operation, especially in any applications involving ''databases''.  At the present moment you are forced to use an intermeditae temporary file to copy from a file to itself.  This is not only burdensome, but it sometimes results in a fairly large performance penalty.''Frank''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Kaplan.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
