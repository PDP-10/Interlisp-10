I  did a MKDIR  on my DSK volume  earlier today, running this sysout.  I later logged out, fetched this same sysout from PHYLUM and booted.  I am running mesa 11.0.''I am at this point slightly frustrated.  This same behavior has persecuted med now for several months.  It is especially frutstrating since calling (MAKEPILOT ''DSK) ALSO throws me in a 9318!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don''t have a lisp volume which works, and I can''t get a PILOT volume that works.  I certainly hope I don''t have to spend another 2 hours reconfiguring my disk for the nth time.''    Per-Kristian  ''-----''mjs 8/14':  I current suspect a hardware problem.
