I can''t redefine DIRECTORIES, because my 3-lisp doesn''t necessarily know what system it''s running in.  I think that''s the responsibility of lisp, not of my system''-----''Date': 29 May 84 05':38 PDT'From': Wallace.pa'Subject': Lisp': Loading EXPORTS.ALL blows irreperably into RAID'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Shrager, Desrivieres''Lisp System Date': 28-May-84 19':09':20'Machine': Dorado (CSLI-6)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': Always'Impact': Fatal''(FILESLOAD EXPOSRTS.ALL) in the latest FULL.SYSOUT blows you into RAID.  ^D and ^N are to no avail, one must ^K.
