The middle button accelerator on the icon has made me thirsty for more.  I would like the expansion of the icon to also do a getmail (and followed by, come to think of it, a display).  This can be done by putting an expandfn on the browse window if I had a way of locating the window.  (I guess I only want this on my active.mail browser.)  Is there a blessed way of finding the browse window for active.mail?  Is there any problem with using  \LAFITE.GETMAIL as the expandfn?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 30-May-84 15':17':11Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: Priority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
