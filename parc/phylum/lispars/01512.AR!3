However, bizarrely enough, when I hit return, the line I entered was entirely wiped!  Now, this really isn''t a problem since there are at least a million other ways I could put in a marginal note. I was just curious why this might be, since it must have taken someone some programming effort to do this obscure thing.''Cheers,'	Jeff''-----''Subject': Re': Lisp': ";" at start of line vanishes -- poof!'In-reply-to': Shrager''s message of 26 Jun 84 02':30 PDT'To': Shrager'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''I tried tracking this down, and I still don''t know why the line disappears.  ";" is defined on LISPXHISTORYMACROS as (; NIL NIL), so it makes sense that it doesn''t go on the history list, but I see no reason for it to erase the line.  I will submit an AR for someone to track this down eventually -- soulnd like a symptom of a bug.''------'Date': 23 Aug 84 12':36 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1512': ProgAsst command ";" at start of line vanishes''Now fixed.  The problem was an age old "feature" in TTYIN wherein you could anywhere (not just at Lisp exec) type a line starting with ; and have it ignored.  I have changed this feature so it is under the control of yet another global variable, TTYINCOMMENTCHAR, initially NIL':  (Note for release)''If the first character on a line of typein is eq to TTYINCOMMENTCHAR (a character code or NIL), then the line is treated as a comment, and no input function will see it.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 23-Aug-84 13':28':29
