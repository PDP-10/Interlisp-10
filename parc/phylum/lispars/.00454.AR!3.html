The initial value for FIXSPELL.UPPERCASE.QUIET is NIL, which turns OFF the feature (making the system work differently than it does now.)''The edit was quite trivial; there was a special clause in FIXSPELL which implemented this feature, and I just wrapped a (AND FIXSPELL.UPPERCASE.QUIET --) around it.''I''m uncertain whether to document the variable, or just to announce that the system behavior changed.''I''m working from home and don''t trust the maxc version of the compiler any more ; so I''ve merely stored the updated source of SPELL on &lt;LispCore&gt;Sources&gt; without the corresponding SPELL.DCOM. If noone else gets to it, I will compile it upon my return.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':12':24</pre>
