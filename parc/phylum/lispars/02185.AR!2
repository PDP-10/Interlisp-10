I find that CTRL-shift deletions can, after they are finished, leave behind ghost selections.  I delete some text, the text goes away properly, but some text underneath the deletion appears to become selected somehow.  Since if I do a redisplay, the ghost selection goes away, I assume there is some problem with the display routines here.  The following test case will illustrate the problem.  Edit a file with about 80 lines of text, say 80 lines of "ASDF<CR>", getting a window like'     ----------------'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     ----------------'where lines not shown fall off the bottom of the window.  Delete the last two lines, "ASDF<CR>ASDF<CR>" of the window.  This deletion should work OK.  If you again delete the last two lines, you get'     ----------------'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !#####         !'     ----------------'where ##### the text "ASDF<CR>" which appears selected, but isn''t.  You can keep deleting the last few lines of the window to and continue to get similar effects.  You can also see the effect by deleting just a portion of the last visible line.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 18-Sep-84 12':27':15
