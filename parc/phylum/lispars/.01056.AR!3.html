Number: 1056Date:  9-May-84 13':40':11Submitter: JonL.paSource: Eric Lazarus (of Ean-Tech)Subject: TTYIN shouldn''t flash window after &uarr;XLisp Version:  7-May-84 21':48':06Description: 'A flashing of the window implies, somehow, that an error has been committed; TTYIN''s &uarr;X command should just go to the "end", which isn''t in-and-of-itself an error.  If the type-in is completed at that point, the systems types a CR, so one can distinguish the two cases without needing a "flasher".''-----''Date': 12 May 84 16':29 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1056': TTYIN shouldn''t flash window after &uarr;X'To': JonL'cc': vanMelle.pa, LispSupport''Depends on your point of view.  The &uarr;X command means "exit", and if your parens aren''t balanced you can''t exit; hence, that is an "error", if you insist.  I would be annoyed to type &uarr;X and have it seem like it did nothing (other than move the caret towards the end, not a very conspicuous change).  Although a successful &uarr;X does "type a CR", that is not always highly visible--only when you''re at the bottom of the window, so that scrolling is induced.''Thus I''ll decline this one in the absence of any more convincing argument or overwhelming user preference.''	Bill''-----''Date': 14 May 84 18':46 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': AR 1056 TTYIN shouldn''t flash window after &uarr;X'To': 1100Support.pasa'cc': LispSupport, vanMelle, JonL.pa''I "submitted" this AR for Eric Lazarus of Ean-Tech (he physically came into my office with several bug reports).  Could you reply to him -- ERIC@SRI-KL -- about the status of this one, namely that it got AR number 1056, and that it was declined by the implementor of TTYIN on the grounds that the semantics of  &uarr;X is "finish up" rather than "go to end of line".''-- JonL --'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-May-84 17':12':20Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TTYINMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
