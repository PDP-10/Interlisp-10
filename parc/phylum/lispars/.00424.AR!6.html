I was asked the question about updating the folder. My model of this situation is that I''d get the same result regardless of which answer I give, as nothing has changed in tghis clean file. If this is so, why not omit asking the question at all? General principle': don''t ask a question the answer to which will not be used. Reason': 1) It causes the user to try to figure out why the program would want to know, thus making more difficult the formation/support of the user''s model. 2) It is unnecessary interaction.''Austin''-----''Date':  1 Apr 84 22':42 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': On Closing a browser.'In-reply-to': Ahenderson.pa''s message of 31 Mar 84 11':29 PST'To': Ahenderson.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa''If indeed no Update needs to be done, then Close does not ask.  I suspect what you''re observing is that Lafite considers Update needed if the file does not have an up to date table of contents (you browsed the file and it had to parse it first).  Even though nothing else changed, Lafite wants to write out a toc file so that next time you browse the file it is easier.  Not sure how to best handle this, except perhaps for Lafite to remember "toc needed" as a separate case from "Update needed" and prompt accordingly.''	Bill''-----''Date': 19 Apr 84 08':59 PST'From': Moran.pa'Subject': Lafite': Closing a Browser'To': LafiteSupport.pa'cc': Moran.pa'Lafite-System-Date': 28-Feb-84 13':10':33'Lisp-System-Date':  9-Apr-84 18':28':19'Machine-Type': Dorado''If I open a browser window, look at a few messages,  and then close it, it gives me this this ridiculous "update options menu", which is irrelevant since I didn''t change anything.  Lafite ought to keep track of whether anything has been changed in the browser before bothering the user with this menu.''NB.  This suggestion relates to an earlier one I sent a few days ago concerning the options on the Update command.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date:  5-Jun-84 14':08':52</pre>
