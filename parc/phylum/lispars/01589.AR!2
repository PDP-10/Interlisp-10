Getting into Lisp, that same volume to see if MScavenge.Log is in the Dsk directory.  Nothing is found.  MScavenge.log is in Diagnostics volume not in Lisp Hard disk.  Customers do not have access back to Tajo to get the log file from scavenging the disk.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Jul-84 14':16':17Attn: JFung.PasaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
