For the benefit of those who may encounter this, here is the situation':''When you button PUT in the Tedit pup-up menu, it prints "File to PUT to': <filename>" in the small prompt window on top of the Tedit window.  If you type CR, it will put the document in the named file; or you can type another file name followed by CR.''If you don''t happen to notice this prompt, and select "Put" from the pop-up menu again, the prompt window is cleared and "Put in progress; please wait" is printed.  This is what had happened to the people who came to me for help':  it looked like Tedit was taking forever to do a simple Put, when in actuality it was still in PROMPTFORWORD, waiting for the user to confirm the file name to put to.  This problem is made worse when the full file name is wider than the prompt window, so that only the end of the "File to PUT to" prompt is printed.''If you find yourself in this situation, click the mouse in the Tedit prompt window.  If the caret starts blinking there, that is a good indication that it is waiting for the user to type something.  Now, if you type control-E, this will abort the put, and you can try again.''An associated problem':  Currently, PROMPTFORWORD uses a monitor lock, so that two processes cannot use it at the same time.  Therefore, if you select Put from one Tedit window, do not answer the prompt, and then select Put from ANOTHER Tedit window, it will seem to hang, because PROMPTFORWORD is waiting for the first prompt to be answered.''This problem should be fixed soon.  Note that this is only a problem with the pop-up menus; the expanded menu does not use PROMPTFORWORD.''-----''Date':  2 Jul 84 20':15 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Tedit PUT takes forever if you don''t confirm it'In-reply-to': Sannella.PA''s message of 28 Jun 84 12':14':21 PDT (Thursday)'To': Sannella.PA'cc': LispUsers^.pa''Subsequent versions of PROMPTFORWORD will change the cursor to a distinctive pattern, so at least there will be some continuous, graphic reminder during the time that some process is blocked waiting for PROMPTFORWORD input.''-- JonL --''-----''Date':  2-Jul-84 21''':00''':55'Source': Sybalsky'Subject': Make TEdit aware that it is waiting for filenames &c'Problem Type': Design - UI'Machine': 1132'Description': When TEdit is waiting for input under Promptfor Word, it shouldn''''t give the "...operation in progress" msg, but should flash and redisplay the request for info.?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Jul-84 15':21':01Attn: Syblaksy, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
