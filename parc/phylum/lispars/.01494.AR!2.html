RESETRESTORE and the macro for RESETFORM expand into APPLY and cause breaks within the break.  RESETRESTORE is on APUTDQ.  I would like your opinion before I go into APUTDQ and change the macros for RESETFORM to use \SAFEAPPLYx.  Am I on the right track??'richard'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: burton.paEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 19':56':45</pre>
