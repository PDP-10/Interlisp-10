On the Dandelion, this command causes the Lisp to log out, plopping the system (after a long wait) into Tajo.  I suppose, if there were some way to write a command file on Tajo and some way to get back to LISP from Tajo that this would be a reasonable simulation of what happens on a PDP-10.   But as far as I know, there isn''t, and even if there were the PDP-10 command string (and the function name) would be inappropriate and have to be rewritten.  Now, it just looks like the system crashed.  I suggest that the code test for a Dandelion and call a break with a message obsolete function.  If someone does develope the system hopping code, it should be in a function with a different nameWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
