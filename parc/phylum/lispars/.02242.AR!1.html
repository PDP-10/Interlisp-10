I guess I said "NIL".  Then after editing the AR, and bugging PUT, it created a wholly new AR -- 2231, which I subsequently emasculated of all of its fields so that it wouldn''t "show up".''WHat happened?  A second attempt to work on 1060 succeeded, and this time, after PUTting, it no longer asks about BRAVO conversion.''-- JonL --''-----''Subject': Re': BRAVO conversion in AREDIT?'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 24 Sep 84 03':43 PDT'To': JonL.pa'cc': Sannella.pa''Hmmm... somehow, a &uarr;Z got into the end of the description field, and Tedit thought it was a Bravo file when AREDIT included it into the AREDIT form.  If it happens again, just answer yes...it won''t hurt the AR.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
