Compiler processed the 'entire file, and then got a break': Error in Courier program FILING, 'procedure STORE': TRANSFER ERROR. Exiting via <uparrow> and retrying gave'same error."' ' ' 'In addition, I''ve certainly noticed that if you TCOMPL a long file on an'NS file server, if the screen goes black with PAGEFULLFN when its 'printed the first batch of functions,  and you wait a bit before hitting'a key, the compilation will also fail with some kind of NS filing error.'Thats in Fugue6 too.' ' ' 'Next, we have had a lot of trouble doing MAKEFILEs of LOOPS objects to 'our file servers, although MAKEFILE to DSK and then COPYFILE of the 'resultant file works fine. ' ' ' 'Finally, I have never successfully LOADed the file FONTS.WIDTHS from an 'NS file server running CAROL, although again, COPYFILE to DSK followed 'by LOAD from DSK works fine.' ' ' 'My view (based on no knowledge whateverof the guts of NS filing) is that'somehow the connection is getting timed out whenever the Lisp machine 'does anything complex either when reading or writing an NS file, 'possibly because the process that reads and writes the stream is tied up'with some computation rather than doing whatever handshaking it should 'be doing.' 'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter
