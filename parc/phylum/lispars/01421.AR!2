I think that the Star or XDE design is just 'fine for most of them. In particular, using Larger/Smaller to change font size,'using Font to pop up a menu of choices (maybe with some chance of typing in a 'new font name in a pop-up prompt window), using Superscript/Subscript (may 'require moving lock/unlock elsewhere), using "Next" to hit next fillin slot, 'and shift-Next to hit previous one, using the "Find" button to invoke Find, 'etc. These interface engineering tasks are imperative for the acceptance of 'TEdit, even though they don''t affect the ''engine'' underneath. The lack of these'kinds of features is probably the major motivation for the retrograde movement 'to the weaker EMacs interface. While we need EMacs for other reasons, we 'shouldn''t let it win for stupid reasons. There''ve been a variety of complains 'from users about this. My rough cut on design is "Make it look like Star or 'XDE, since that is what they designed the keyboard for."'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 12':48':18
