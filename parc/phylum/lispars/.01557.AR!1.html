Problem is, when I go to debug it, TELERAID breaks for one cause or another;  principally,  it can''t seem to print out the frames.  First attempt to do a 'F 1'command led to the break 'NON-NUMERIC ARG '"{cdr of non-list}"'underneath VNTYPX (called by V\UNCOPY).  A second try led to an invalid addr underneath VGETBASEPTR0.''What to do?''-- JonL --''-----''Date': 13 Jun 84 12':21 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': TeleRaid'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 12 Jun 84 18':57 PDT'To': JonL.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa, LispSupport.pa''That might well be the bug in interpreting LISTP''s, wherein if given a pointer which points to the beginning of a LISTP page (e.g. a local inside of \CONS.UFN), it tries to interpret it as a regular LISTP and gets in trouble.  Generally it will have already printed an open paren before falling into a break or invalid addr.''Otherwise no guesses.''	Bill''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Bootstrapping and TeleraidMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
