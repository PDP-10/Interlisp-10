I'don''t believe there should be anything wrong with your floppy, but'{FLOPPY}''s info in core is confused.  I''d appreciate more background'on this problem if you can repeat it.  Probable workaround is to just'open & close the floppy drive door, which will flush {FLOPPY}''s cached'directory structure.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Roach.paEdit-Date: 23-Jul-84 00':09':37
