Number: 2244Date: 24-Sep-84 15':04':22Submitter: MasinterSource: MasinterSubject: want a standard BTREE package in Interlisp-DAssigned To: Attn: Lisp, StansburyStatus: OpenIn/By: Problem Type: PerformanceImpact: ModerateDifficulty: Frequency: Priority: PerhapsSystem: Other SoftwareSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Lisp Version: 24-Sep-84 09':49':01Source Files: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: '["Sannella.PA" "24-Sep-84 16':32':11" Problem% Type':(-&gt;Performance) Impact':(-&gt;Moderate) Priority':(-&gt;Perhaps) System':(-&gt;Other% Software) Subsystem':(-&gt;Other)]Description: ''The BTREE package is one that has been used to good effect in IFS and a large number of other Xerox systems. It is better than HASH for databases (extensible, mimized file access, etc.) and is well debugged. This project involves translating the system from Mesa and debugging it.''Date': 18 Sep 84 09':02':20 PDT'From': Swinehart.pa'Subject': Re': BTree package'In-reply-to': "Your message of 18 SEP 84 06':44 PDT"'To': MASINTER'Cc': swinehart''[Indigo]&lt;Cedar5.1&gt;Btree&gt;BTree.mesa  describes the interfaces for the basic package. '[Indigo]&lt;Cedar5.1&gt;BtreeSimple&gt;BTreeSimple.mesa describes a simplified version (more done for the client, fewer client loopholes, ugh)''I''ve printed both on Quake under my name.''[Indigo]&lt;Cedar5.2&gt;Top&gt;BTree.df and ... BTreeSimple.df are the complete descriptions for these packages.  The mesa files are probably Tioga-formatted, so if you can''t make out what''s going on, let me know what files you want listings of.''The BCPL versions are presumably on [indigo]&lt;Altosource&gt;Btree.dm, or some such nonsense.  I wouldn''t expect them to be easier to read than the Mesa ones, but who knows.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 24-Sep-84 16':32':12</pre>
