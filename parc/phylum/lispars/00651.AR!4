I used the PSW command WHO? to find out that the MOUSE had the KBD.''What I did was':'I was chatting to maxc; I logged out and CLOSEed the window.'Then I used Lafite to read some mail.  I don''t know who hd the tty then; I suspect the exec window, for that''s what normally happens.'I then exited Lafite by shrinking the window.  I tried typing to the exec and discovered that it wasn''t being echoed.  That''s when I called up the PSW.''david''-------'Date': 11 Apr 84 17':11 PST'From': vanMelle.pa''LispSupport': Subject not at all right!  I see nothing in this bug report that says nobody had the keyboard.  In fact, the Mouse had it.  I see nothing wrong with being in this state, although it would be nice if Lisp didn''t get into the state unnecessarily.''Reason the mouse had it (probably) is a Tedit problem, one I just reported.  So, disposition': superseded by that AR.''David': When you see no caret flashing, just click in the window you want to type in.''	Bill''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 15-May-84 14':36':32
