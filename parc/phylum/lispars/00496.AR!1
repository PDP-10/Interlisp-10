Thus, you can have multiple instances of PAINTW running in the same window.''As Richard says, perhaps there should be two "clipping" regions per window - one, the actual region of the window, and the other used for clipping lines, etc.  The window software would maintain the first, and users could safely tweak the other to their hearts'' content.'	HerbWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
