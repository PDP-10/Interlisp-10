Suggestions':''1. Separate the arguments and the local variables.  I often find it confusing that I can''t tell where the args leave off and the locals begin.''2. Print the names of localvar arguments in a manner analogous to the way localvar prog vars are printed, to make it clearer that their names are not visible on the stack.  E.g., print *FOO* instead of FOO.  That way I can easily tell whether I can type in the break an expression that involves such a variable.''3. Have left-button always print ALL the arguments at least, even if they are localvars.  Most people know, for example, that IPLUS has arguments, and it is confusing or at least annoying to left-button the \SLOWIPLUS2 frame and have NO arguments printed.  In the case of functions that have some localvar and some specvar args, the left-button printout can be very confusing (Danny just came to me completely perplexed by this--"why does the backtrace show different args than ARGLIST?").Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date:  7-Jun-84 16':28':33Attn: Burton, MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm 7Jun84': raised priority]System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Break PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
