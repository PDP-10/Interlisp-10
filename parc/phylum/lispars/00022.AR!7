If I select the cr at the end of a paragraph and type <cr><New text>, the new text is in a font that appears to have nothing to do with any font nearby.  All the text in the neighborhood is in TimesRoman10, and the new text is in TimesRoman12 Bold, which is not even a font that I have breathed a word of in this editing session (though it is the font of the first character of the file, if that matters).''If I instead select the text before the final cr (caret is in same place, but selection is some TimesRoman10 text instead of the invisible cr), then I get the new text in TimesRoman10 as I expect.''I did notice, though, and applaud, that the looks of my typein are no longer affected by something that I copy select.  That is, I can copy an italicized word and not have my typein thereafter be in italics.''	Bill''-----''Date': 28 Mar 84 14':20 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': AR 22 Declined/fixed'To': Lispsupport'cc': Sybalsky.pa''Mike--''I cannot replicate AR 22 (caret looks trouble from BVM).  I think he was bitten by the CR he selected being in TR 12 B, instead of TR10 as he thought.  Please mark the AR appropriately--I''m not sure which it should be.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':40':00Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
