If possible, *all* Interlisp-D users should receive copies of all such release documents.''---Jim      ''-----''Date': Wed, 21 Mar 84 14':03 PST'From': Raim.pasa'Subject': Re': AR 224': Internal users should get release info'In-reply-to': "Your message of 21 Mar 84 12':39':22 PST (Wednesday)"'To': LispSupport.PA'cc': Raim''Michael,''A good question. ''Til now, Xerox people have gotten all Interlisp technical documentation either from release messages or files stored on Phylum.

They should be able to get it for free bygrabbing the right press files; or at some nominal cost if they want bound editions (forthcoming with the next release.)''--Marty'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 17-Jul-84 17':05':48Attn: Raim,SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [17jul84, LMM': changed status back to "Open"': I think until there has been a message to LispUsers&uarr; describing how to order internal documentation, that this AR has not been "Fixed".]System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Release ProcedureMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
