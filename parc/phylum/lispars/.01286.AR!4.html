The DEI(Digital Ethernet Interface) is another PUP implementation that runs on VAX''s VMS operating system.''We run into problem with DEI with a file pathname of [host]&lt;directory&gt;lisp.sysout specified in the "file" paramenter. ''The workaround turns out to be '[host]directory&gt;lisp.sysout  (note the missing left angle bracket on directory)''Can I ask you to try this workaround syntax and see whether this will create any incompatability problem on your side.  I.e. if you try to install a file without this "&lt;" will you get any problems.''Please give this a try on both your 2060 and Unix servers.  Thanx very much.'''Jerry''-----''Return-Path': SCHMIDT@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA'Received': from SUMEX-AIM.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 14 MAY 84 22':51':02 PDT'Date': Mon, 14 May 84 22':50':50 PDT'From': Christopher Schmidt &lt;SCHMIDT@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA&gt;'Subject': Re': Another test try'To': JFung.pasa'cc': LispSupport.pa'In-Reply-To': Message from "JFung.pasa@XEROX.ARPA" of Wed 9 May 84 17':26':47-PDT''	I have been on vacation for a week, and didn''t see your last letter'until today.  I''ll try booting with the bogus syntax off of TOPS20 tomorrow'or the next day.  There are no &lt; in unix pathnames, so it doesn''t make sense'to test with that implementation.'	I don''t think you should have the ILT strip out the &lt; though.'Users of a bogus implementation of PUP FTP should simply type the'bogus pathname.  A bug should be explicit or fixed.  Introducing a bug'into the ILT to hide a bug in the DEI PUP FTP will almost certainly'come back to haunt you at some point in the future.'--Christopher''-------''Return-Path': SCHMIDT@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA'Received': from SUMEX-AIM.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 15 MAY 84 10':11':41 PDT'Date': Tue, 15 May 84 10':11':01 PDT'From': Christopher Schmidt &lt;SCHMIDT@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA&gt;'Subject': Re': Another test try'To': JFung.pasa'cc': LispSupport.pa, Wogulis.pasa'In-Reply-To': Message from "JFung.pasa@XEROX.ARPA" of Wed 9 May 84 17':26':47-PDT''	I booted [turing]1100.fugue4&gt;lisp.sysout off of a TOPS-20 this'morning with success.
