Number: 91Date: 17-Mar-84  0':12':19Submitter: roach.PASource: Subject: TTYIN doesn''t work in &uarr;B break windowsLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 16 JAN 84 12':12 PST'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': TTYIN &amp; &uarr;B BREAK WINDOWS'To':   LISPSUPPORT'cc':   ROACH''     MAKESYSDATE 14-Jan-84 17':06':24, Machine Dlion.'     I find that break windows produced via &uarr;B don''t behave as nice as'they used to.  When I interrupt my typing to the EXEC window with a &uarr;B'I get a break window just as I should.  But I cannot position the'caret with the mouse in this break window.  I am unable to backspace'to a preceding line in a multiple line input in the break window.  If'I do a &uarr;B in the break window, instead of recursion I get "Break'within a break on \SAVEVMBACKGROUND&lt;cr&gt;\SAVEVMBACKGROUND&lt;cr&gt;'unbroken.help!&lt;cr&gt;&lt;cr&gt;(HELP broken)", a "HELP': NIL NIL  break':1"'window, etc.''-----''Date':  4 Apr 84 19':34 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'91': The first half of this should have been TTYIN, attn to me; it is now fixed.  The second half has nothing to do with TTYIN': it is "Typing &uarr;B in a break window gives a "Break within Break" error".  Impact': Annoying, Difficulty': Hard.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 26-Apr-84  9':34':52Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: vanMelle.paIn/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TTYINMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: FixedProblem Type: BugSource Files: BREAK, TTYIN</pre>
