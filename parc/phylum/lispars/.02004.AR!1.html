I want to load a file, that has macros in it that are to be used during a compilation.  How do I do this?''(DECLARE': EVAL@COMPILE (FILES ...))''didn''t do anything as far as I can tell.  It certainly didn''t cause the compiler to load the desired files.''Can there be multiple declare statements?''I presume that the compiler runs from the top of a file to the end.  If this is so, then how can it predefine compiler macros?!  In fact, in order to make my macros work right, I had to explicitly move the (MACROS ...) filepkg command before the rest of my fns.  If the whole file read and THEN compiled?!  If so, you should make this explicit someplace.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
