For example, I have seen hyphenated atoms like "create-file-pointer" read as "createfile-pointer"; i.e., some, but not all hyphens dropped.  Second example': "''foobar" read as "foobar".  Note that when it happens, it is persistent --- reading the expression again always produces the same result.  However, doing a PUT, QUIT, GET has always cured the problem, so Tedit has got things straight.  ''We it happens again, I''ll try to find one of you to take a look at it.''---Jim''-----''From': kaplan.pa'Date': 31-Mar-84 21':44':01 PST'Subject': Tedit bug'To': TeditSupport'''Halvorsen reports a bug in the TEDIT shift and control-shift mechanism, as indicated below.  If you are not already aware of this, please check with him for details.''I would consider this a FATAL  bug, since it seems to muck up the users file.  If it can be fixed easily, the fix should be installed and a new Tedit released ASAP.  If it can''t be fixed quickly and it is newly introduced, then Tedit should be backed up to the last known working version.  If it can''t be fixed and can''t be backed up, then a new Tedit should be released ASAP that disables control-shift entirely, pending a final fix.  ''--Ron'''----------''Date': 27 Mar 84 15':10 PST'From': halvorsen.pa'Subject': Subject': LFG editors'To': LFG&uarr;.pa'cc': halvorsen.pa''There is a bug in the TEDIT shift and control-shift mechanism which will cause you problems if you try to use these features of TEDIT when editting rules or grammars.  ''Try typing the text in instead of shift-selecting, and you will get a more predictable result.''The bug in question is one which omits  characters from the file, while displaying them on the screen.  You think you are ok from looking at your editting window, but in fact you are not.''	Per-Kristian''-----''Date':  2 Apr 84 13':56 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': Tedit bug'In-reply-to': kaplan.pa''s message of 31-Mar-84 21':44':01 PST'To': kaplan.pa'cc': TeditSupport.pa''After pondering his description for a while, I figured out that it''s an instance of the "characters getting dropped when READing from a TExtStream" bug--assuming this is the same problem he showed me about a week ago.''The bug has been found and fixed, and will be in the next release of TEdit.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':23':47Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
