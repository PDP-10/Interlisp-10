It worked by doing a trace and sweep garbage collection and returning the list of pointers.  This was great for all sorts of debugging.  Can this be done in Lisp?''-----''Date': 27 Mar 84 15':24 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR120': Cedar-type WhoPointsTo'To': Maxwell'cc': LispSupport, vanMelle.pa''The Library package GCHAX has a function \FINDPOINTER that does the job more crudely and perhaps less reliably--not by a mark and sweep GC but just by a sweep of memory.  I have found it quite useful for finding storage leaks.  I don''t know what other purposes you had in mind.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 28-Mar-84  9':54':19Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Storage Formats/MgtMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Very HardFrequency: Impact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: WishProblem Type: Source Files: </pre>
