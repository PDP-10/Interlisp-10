The most typical attached configuation (e.g., TEdit) is simply a stack, and I would like to be able to merely reshape the two windows that border on one another such that it appears that I''ve moved the border between them.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-Aug-84 20':24':19</pre>
