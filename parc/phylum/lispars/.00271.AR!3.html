It appears that the user has to type  DC FOO.LSP    Seems like DC FOO should probably work.  One place to fix it is in HASDEF which current just checks (MEMB  foo FILELST).  I can fix it to look at FILELST and see if any elements of it are of the form FOO.xxx.  Is this going to mess up other things?
