YOu can most easily see this if you '(SETSYNTAX ''A ''(MACRO (LAMBDA (X) (HELP]''i.e., make "A" be a readmacro in the NIL readtable. Then if you type in (QUOTE A) you''ll see the SYSPRETTYFLG difference. Also, ?? printout of the history list is bad.

What in the world does SYSPRETTYFLG have to do with this?  I thought NOESCQUOTE vs. ESCQUOTE was supposed to make the difference.  This happens on the 10, VAX and Dolphin.  It''s not just a matter of whether the atom is being prettyprinted - the same thing happens if I do PRINTs.  It also happens for other characters than ''.''-----''Date': 19 Mar 84 19':23 PST'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': ESCQUOTE'In-reply-to': Don.Cohen <DONC@USC-ISIF.ARPA>''s message of 16 Mar 84 18':55 PST'To': DONC@USC-ISIF'cc': LISPSUPPORT''Apparently, SYSPRETTYFLG causes output to be printed with the NIL readtable instead of the T readtable.
