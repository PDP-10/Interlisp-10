Since'EXPANDMACRO exists, it ought be be clear that the kludgy techniques such as'found in the FGETD macro are totally inadequate.'''[note from LMM': doesn''t EXPANDMACRO sometimes want to expand the optimizer? Is there an EXPANDOPTIMIZER which is different than EXPANDMACRO?]Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 27-Jun-84 14':04':58Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Compiler, Code FormatMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: Priority: PerhapsStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
