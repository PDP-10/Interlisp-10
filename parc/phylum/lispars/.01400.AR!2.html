As I worked, it got progressively slower and slower to the point of intolerability. Luckily the day ended; I logged out. The next morning I restarted the volume just as the LOGOUT had left it. And it was back running at high speed again! And so it continued for the rest of that day': it would get slower and slower over a 1 to 2 hour span; then I''d logout, restart the volume, and be running again fine.''I noticed that when it was running slowly there was very little disk-write activity and lots of disk-read. ''I mentioned this to Larry, who wondered about whether I had the mechanism which writes dirty pages at the end of the sysout running. How do I find out? I did not have SPY loaded so I couldn''t "see" where the time was being spent. I''ll try to reproduce the effect here, load SPY and get more info. Help and suggestions appreciated.''Austin''-----''Date': 12 Jun 84 17':04 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1400': Slowdown with time on the DLion fixed by LOGOUT'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 12 Jun 84 16':53':23 PDT (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa''If he had NO disk-writing activity, his symptoms are consistent with him inadvertantly having \VMEM.INHIBIT.WRITE set true.  But I doubt he could last all day that way.  Otherwise, I have no theories.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 28-Jun-84 13':51':30Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Virtual MemoryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
