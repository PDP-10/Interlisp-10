The class of VECTORs and/or ARRAYS would have specific TIMES and PLUS methods . . .   The UFN for FTIMES2, or indeed for any arithmetic operation, would handle very few cases directly (e.g., floatps, fixps); rather it would "send a TIMES message", which basically means finding the class associated with the first arg, and fetching the method from it.'''-- JonL --''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
