The ''story'' is that the 10MB configuration is only reasonable for sites that have a random access file server or are willing to run connected to {FLOPPY}; I think we can continue with that story and leave {DSK} only for INIT.LISP and a few scratch files.''I think LOOPS reaches 12000 pages easily, which is why I don''t think 11689 is reasonable.''If there isn''t an AR about reducing the size of the Diagnostics volume, there should be, even if the Difficulty is Very Hard.''Larry''-----''Date': 14 May 84 18':20 PDT'From': stansbury.pa'Subject': Re': Dlion partitions for Carol'In-reply-to': JFung.pasa''s message of 14 May 84 17':53':11 PDT (Monday)'To': JFung.pasa'cc': Stansbury.pa, Raim.pasa, Masinter.pa, LispSupport.pa''Sounds fine, except':'1.  Should make lisp volume on 10 mb the last volume.'2.  Making the dsk volume as small as 200 pages on the 10 mb would make it worse than useless': I think you''d get out of disk space errors all the time.  If you really need that much more vmem space, you should probably omit the dsk volume from the 10 mb machine altogether, and continue to  use coredevice dsk (not a very savory alternative).'3.  I thought you had to up the diagnostics volume size to 4000 pages.  Glad you could keep it at 3500.'4.  In the prometheus script, there should be an entry for booting diagnostics.  I have gotten stuck a couple of times and had to use othello to reset the boot pointers -- not good.'''-- Tayloe.''-----''Date': 15 May 84 10':04':41 PDT (Tuesday)'From': JFung.pasa'Subject': Re': Dlion partitions for Carol'In-reply-to': stansbury.pa''s message of 14 May 84 18':20 PDT'To': Stansbury.pa, Masinter.pa'cc': JFung, Raim, LispSupport.pa''Thanks for the replies.''	1.

Glad you could keep it at 3500.'	'4000 Pages is the recommned size for Mesa 11 Klamath''s release.  When it is installed, we should know the free pages and see what size we need.'''	4.  In the prometheus script, there should be an entry for booting diagnostics.  I have gotten stuck a couple of times and had to use othello to reset the boot pointers -- not good.'	'This will be corrected.'''	2)  DSK remains at 1000 pages on 10Mb.  Larry':  The other option for 10Mb will be to have 1 LOOPS volume and no DSK volume?  Do you want this? '''If there isn''t an AR about reducing the size of the Diagnostics volume, there should be, even if the Difficulty is Very Hard.''I think by having a customoized boot file, the other advantage we gain is not the space but the SPEED.  The time to do the 1-boot can be shortened.  I heard in Klamath''s release the 1-boot time has been shortened.  I am waiting to find this out.
