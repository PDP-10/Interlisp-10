I realize that process names move around when the window greys out, so you''ll have to use the old regions descriptions and apply them to the new window, in order to implement what I''m suggesting, but it is probably not very hard.''-- Jeff''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
