After I''ve deleted them, I want to expunge them, but I don''t want to wait around for it to re-enumerate and display the directory.''What I''d like to see instead is a menu that pops up when you try to close the browser, like when you close a Lafite browser': you can tell it to expunge and close, or just close (forgetting what you marked as deleted.) When you shrink it, you should get a similar menu (plus a reasonable icon, please).''/ EricWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84  9':15':58Attn: Assigned To: JellinekIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: Fixed, not released (Jellinek, 4-23-84)System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: LibraryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
