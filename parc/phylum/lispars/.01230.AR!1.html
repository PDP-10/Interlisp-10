In other words, after you re-enter Lisp and do a (MKDIR ''DSK), the DSK volume is still marked as having only, say, 2000 free pages.  I reality, the Erase should have reset the free page count so that the volume now has 10,000 free pages.  Doing a (\DFSInit) does not seem to clear the situation.'''Frank''-----''mjs 5/24/84''Subject': Re': Lisp': DLIONFS fails to update free pages after logical volume is erased in Othello'In-reply-to': Halasz''s message of 21 May 84 22':31 PDT'To': Halasz'cc': LispSupport'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''This is true.  The next release will include documentation saying that the only way to erase a DLionfs volume is to (1) physical volue scavenge the disk (2) erase the volume (3) load in a new lisp.  I agree, this is totally inconvenient, but it is the best that we can do right now (we have to release the DLionFS soon, and we can''t afford to wait until it is perfect).''I have submitted an AR on this, though.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 24-May-84 16':01':31Attn: StansburyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
