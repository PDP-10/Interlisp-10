BITBLT is the most important because it is the bottleneck in RS322 chat, and not getting interrupts means that it isn''t possible to service the port rapidly even if we enabled interrupt-on-character-pending.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 11-Apr-84 17':44':15Attn: CharnleyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
