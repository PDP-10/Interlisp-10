Occasionally &lt;TAB&gt; no longer seems to work in the CHAT window.  At one point I was able to see that (KEYACTION ''TAB) returned (IGNORE . IGNORE).  Since DEDIT has messed up the TAB key in the past, I suspect that DEDIT is guilty somehow.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 16':21':48Attn: Assigned To: In/By: AR 869Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: SupersededProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
