I''d like a new version of the compiler that (a) didn''t have the stupid interview stuff at the beginning, (b) kept functions and the forms in the same order on the compiled file as on the source (c) eliminated anything that got dumped by SYSLOAD, (d) got rid of comments (e) adopted a new FASL format that made LOAD blindingly fast.''This would have a large impact on many users perception of the speed of the machine. Compilation would probably be faster too because it wouldn''t have to slosh the characters around for the intermediate expressions.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  5-Jun-84 11':48':03Attn: masinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Compiler, Code FormatMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 8191File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files:
