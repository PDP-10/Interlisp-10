This either fixes or ameliorates, depending on your point of view, AR 31 (too many TTY windows created when you SET in INSPECT).''There is a new process prop RESTARTFORM, which is the form used (instead of the original form given to ADD.PROCESS) if' the process is restarted.  Of course, the process must also have a non-nil RESTARTABLE prop for this to have any effect.''	BillWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':53':38Attn: Assigned To: vanMelle.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
