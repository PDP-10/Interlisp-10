It would always be beneficial to include the data from the FILEDATES property of any Lisp>Library or LispUsers package that is being discussed [1100Support': maybe this could be mentioned explicitly in the next release note, and support personnel could be aware of asking for such information from customers].''Things have developed rapidly in the customer support section at Pasadena, and I believe they are much more coordinated in the releases of Fugue.6 and Carol.  Any chance that you could upgrade to the Carol sysout and library packages, thereby making this bug a moot point?  Nevertheless, we always appreciate the vigil of an active user such as yourself, especially since the DLion development has tended to move Dolphin-specific problems like this one "off to the edge of the page".''-- JonL --''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JonL.paEdit-Date:  4-Sep-84 21':39':52
