Doing a TTYDISPLAYSTREAM 'instead had the unwanted effect of bringing the 'tty window up to the top and obscuring the window being buttoned in a 'particular kind of situation we had, and most of the button''s activities'did not involve printing, so I removed the (RESETFORM (TTYDISPLAYSTREAM ...'from around the whole function and had output explicitly go to \TopLevelTtyWindow.'I''ve changed this by putting the TTYDISPLAYSTREAM around the output expressions,'so we evade the bug, but thought you might want to know about it.''	--- Mitchell'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  7-Aug-84 15':07':26Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
