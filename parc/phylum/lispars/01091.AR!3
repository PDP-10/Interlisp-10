Quick look at the code suggests the RESETSAVE should not be done when ARSTREAM=NIL.  No real harm done, but (CLOSEF NIL) in a process that has no ttydisplaystream has the unfortunate side effect of creating a tty window (which you never see because it never needs to open); hence is slow instead of being a noop.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 14':57':23
