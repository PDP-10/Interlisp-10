We have our own installation tool that expects a different filename (deliberately to avoid confusion).  It''s really hard to create these disks because we have to use MESA (or Kelly Roach) to rename the sysout files.''david''-----''Date':  2 APR 84 12':30 PST'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': AR453'To':   LISPSUPPORT''     More precisely, David''s problem is renaming {FLOPPY}lisp.sysout'to another versionless file name.
