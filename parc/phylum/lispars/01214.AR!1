Judging from its behavior, GETD must simply issue the equivalent of an R <formal> <actual> for each argument to the function that it is expanding.  This has the obvious bad effects': If one of the formal arguments is also a lisp function name (e.g., LIST, ATOM, ...) then each occurrence of the function name gets changed too.  I had a function with an argument named LIST, and this function also invoked LIST.  After substitution of LIST1 for LIST, it attempted to invoke the function LIST1.  Similarly, if one of the formal arguments is rebound in a PROG, the rebound atom also gets substituted.''I suggest that the manual be more explicit on p 17.44 about how it performs this step (and perhaps even mention this potential bug).  I admit that overloading atom names is poor programming practice--it is probably not worth changing the editor itself.' ''--Tom'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sheil.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
