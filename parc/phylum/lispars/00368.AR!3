For a particular function, i.e., not for *all* functions, when I break (from the menu) around an S-expr and then EXIT the Dedit of that function, the function is "automatically" unbreaking.  I am getting a message in the TopLevelW saying "FOO unbroken".  ''	Other functions are breaking as expected in Dedit.  ''	Exiting Dedit to the toplevel and starting again doesn''t help; I now cannot BREAK this function in Dedit without it unbreaking upon EXITing.  ''	I did look at some variables':  BROKENFNS and BRKINFOLST, both originally NIL, are properly set when I perform the BREAK around some S-expr while in the function.  After EXITing, BROKENFNS is NIL and BRKINFOLST is still set to the non-NIL expr.  ''	Some history':  the function had been involved in a Dedit/Break tangle, at one point I fell into a (SHOULDNT).   I ^''ed out to the top level to start over, and the function from then on was unBREAKable.  'Apparently something was not properly reset.'''dan''-----''Date':  8 Apr 84 15':28 PST'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': AR 368': Cannot BREAK S-expr from inside DEdit'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 29 Mar 84 12':32':23 PST (Thursday)'To': jordan'cc': LispSupport''Dan':''I cannot make any sense out of this bug report and cannot replicate anything like it.''I''d be happy to look into it if you can give me a reproducible example or ask me to look at an instance if you cannot give me a reproducible version. But a report that something happens "For a particular function, i.e., not for *all* functions" without a pointer to the defn of said fn is rather hard to make anything of.''Beau''LispSupport': Status': Declined, Reason': Insufficient specification''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 14':37 PST'From': jordan.pa'Subject': Re': AR 368': Cannot BREAK S-expr from inside DEdit'In-reply-to': Sheil.pa''s message of 8 Apr 84 15':28 PST'To': Sheil.pa'cc': jordan.pa, LispSupport.pa''Beau,''	I found the bug I reported to be pretty strange and was not clear on exactly what info to report, as the function was involved in a Dedit/Break tangle, and I also was not able to immediately reproduce it.  I did mention a few variables I thought might be relevant and described the sequence of actions that appeared to have led up to the bug.  ''	I''ve encountered the bug before and, not wanting to see it forgotten, if you can suggest specifically what would be the variables/functions/things to report for a situation like the one I described I will again try to reproduce it, and re-report (or, grab the nearest lispsupporter).
