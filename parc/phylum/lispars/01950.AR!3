Repeating the call to TINYTIDY once or twice clears up the problem.  BTW. I like this way of keeping my screen clean.  However, for those of us with desires for symmetry the TINYTIDY alignment emphasizes the incongruity of the different icons. TINYTIDY should encourage us to settle on a standard icon size and shape.''Per-KristianWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date:  1-Sep-84 12':15':07
