DO (FOR J...Lisp Version: Description: Well, this sounds like a natural for DWIM.  Suppose the user accidentally reuses an iteration variable from an outer loop inside an inner loop thus':'     (FOR J ....'      DO (FOR J ....'          DO ...))'Then DWIM can warn the user just as it does in detecting potentially infinite loops.  I''ve gotten this bug on a couple occasions.  You wind up wondering what''s taking so long and find you have wrong parenthesization etc.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 20':23':36Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: DWIMMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
