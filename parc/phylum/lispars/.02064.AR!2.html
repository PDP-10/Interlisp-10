It''s all very well to have a sentence somewhere that says in most cases windows and streams can be used, but I think it''s better if you include that information in each function description.  For example, you could use BT (bitmap), DS (display stream) and WN (window) and combine them to get DS/WN or whatever. You can probably invent a better set of abbreviations.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.paEdit-Date: 18-Sep-84 17':26':09</pre>
