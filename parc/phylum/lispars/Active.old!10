The .doc file is produced by the Interlisp text editor. It looks like it is binary but the text is all at the beginning (there is some binary formatting information at the end.)having a bigger volume doesn't make lisp run any faster -- it just means that it takes less time before you run out of room. The Maximum that will do any good is 16200 pages.While you use Othello to install it (and can install it on your User volume by changing the name in the Othello scriopt since Lisp doesn't care what volume name you use, don't put it on the same volume with any data that you care about.So: sure, put it on User, but if you want Star to use User, then erase the whole volume first.You must have 768K words = 1536K bytes.*start*01366 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 24 Apr 84 13:19 ESTFrom: Hannaway.wbstSubject: Lisp: Questions about 1108To: LispSupport.pacc: Hannaway.wbstI'm working with someone designing (large) interfaces with Trillium on a Dandelion.  He's been having a lot of problems getting 9915 errors, and once they occur, there seems to be no way to even save all his work.  They come with no warning and the only commonality that I can see is that they happen after working for a long time with one sysout.My questions are:1.  What is a 9915?  We can't find any documentation on it.  I know that you can use Teleraid from another machine after getting this error, but I haven't been able to figure out anything useful to do from it.  Any suggestions?2.  The only reason I can think of for these problems is that he runs out of virtual memory.  Is there any way to check for that?  On the Dolphins, you at least get a break window or sent into Raid when your virtual memory is full.  Do the Dandelions do that?3.  What is the maximum number of pages that the Lisp volume be on the Dandelion?I'd really appreciate any help you can give.  I'm tired of watching people lose 8 hours of work!Thanks a lot.Pat  P.S.  For my own information, what is the maximum number of pages for the Lisp.Virtualmem on a Dolphin?

Gradually, some of these errors are being given seperate MP codes of their own, in the range 9300-9399.  Using Teleraid from a DLion, the most useful things you could do would be to type ^B, which will (usually) return to lisp and cause a break.  From this break, you can find out what the stack was at the time of the error.  It is very important to tell us this information when you report a bug --- "my machine gets a lot of MP 9915 errors" could be anything."Is there any way to check for ... running out of virtual memory" -- typing (STORAGE) will give a printout of the amounts of allocated and free pages for the various datatypes.  The most important numbers are in the summary at the very end; (STORAGE NIL 9999) will just print the summary.  If the number of "free" pages is low, you could indeed have a problem with running out of virtual memory.  If this does seem to be the problem (unlikely), the program may be holding on to a lot of information it doesn't need, and the working set may be expanding unnecessarily."What is the maximum number of pages that the Lisp volume be on the Dandelion?" --  the virtual memory expands up to 16200 pages, at which point the virtual address space runs out.  Therefore, there is no point in configuring a DLion lisp volume with more than 16200 pages, though it is possible.*start*00683 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Return-Path: SCHOEN@SUMEX-AIM.ARPARedistributed: Xerox1100UsersGroup^.PAReceived: from SUMEX-AIM.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 24 APR 84 18:51:38 PSTDate: Sun, 22 Apr 84 14:50:58 PSTFrom: Eric Schoen <Schoen@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA>Subject: Interlan softwareTo: 1100users@SUMEX-AIM.ARPAInterlan and Technology Concepts Inc (which uses Interlan hardware)together might be able to help.

I thought I would try to type in my opinions about th NS character set.The requirement of the Systems Integration Board is that Interlisp use the NS character set as *one of* its *external* representations in files.It says nothing about the *internal* representation, and puts not limit on alternate external representations.The purpose of this meeting is to decide how far to adopt the NS character set as an INTERNAL representation of Interlisp-D.I propose the following going-in position:a) little or no performance or space penalty -- we should look for representations which don't have large overhead.b) upward compatibility with current code -- users won't have to rewrite files and current programs will continue to work unchanged.I think these goals can be met. I think we should consider possibilities that don't meet them only after we've exhausted the ones that do.Algorithms follow representations. The key is to describe the representations, and then examine the algorithms to see if there is any kind of penalty.There are several separate representations to design: strings, atoms, and files. (TEdit buffers may be another.) The major functions affected are:NCHARS, STRPOS, NTHCHAR(CODE), RPLCHAR(CODE), FILEPOS, GETFILEPTR, SETFILEPTR, BIN, BOUT, ....Design choice 1: BIN really means Binary In. It gets an 8 bit byte, and does no translation. Likewise, GETFILEPTR and SETFILEPTR really count bytes, and not 'characters'.(I don't think we can get away from that).NS characters are represented using the 'standard' run coding as documented in the standard. Either form is acceptable on input, although the single escape will probably be used on output.(We may want to put some limits and constraints on what we accept if we want FILEPOS to run acceptably fast)For internal strings and symbols, we have a couple of choices:a) have 8-bit strings and 16-bit stringsb) runcode strings (and symbols)?b makes NTHCHAR(CODE) etc. slowera) wastes some space, and complicates some algorithms.I see absolutely no point in allowing syntax and terminal tables to talk about anything outside of character set 0. We should Avoid Useless Generalities when they are Expensive.I'm sure there is more. I think the best outcome of this meeting would be to generate and flesh out a couple of different design alternatives, with the result being some charter on what kind of data on usage and space need to be gathered to decide between them.One interesting question we've avoided: How does Mesa Do It?     ----- End Forwarded Messages -----*start*03696 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  4 Jun 84 12:24 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: [kamibayashi.FX: JLISP and NS characters Codes]To: lispcore^cc: sheilfyi     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----Date:  4 Jun 84 02:17:17 PDT (Monday)From: kamibayashi.FXSubject:  JLISP and NS characters CodesTo: Kaplan.pacc: Masinter.pa,Becker.pa,Ueda.fx,Ikeo.fx, kamibayashi.FX Ron,   I would like to thank you for your kind advices to our activities such as Interlisp-D, JLISP and LFG.   This is my answer to your message at end of MAY. Now, we are designing and implementing JLISP. Our JLISP is based on your JLISP but we redesigned all functions of prototype JLISP. The major modifications we try are the followings:    For performance improvement  1)New Kana-kanji dictionary structure (added a new field to check grammer)  2)New access method to Kana-kanji dictionary (reduced disk accesses)    For user interface improvement and new facilities  3)Kana-kanji conversion with tail conversion facility  4)String extention(wild card)  5)Short term memory(STM) based compound-word conversion facility  6)The other new ideas     I was very happy when at PARC, you told me that Interlisp-D would employ 16 bit internal code. This is very lucky for handling large charcter set languages such as Japanese and Chinese. You know, LISP is very suitable for Symbolic manupulation and natural language manupulation. Therefore, in Japan we need LISP with the capability of Japanese language to develop any expert systems and the other applications. And because of the nature of LISP, it is very easy to incoporate Japanese handling capabilty to the original Interlisp-D.   We have described the functional spec of JLISP in Japanese. Do you need this document?   We will inform you our requirments on internal representation of Interlisp-D.   Our concerns on consonance with JLISP are the followings (we had alredy disucussed them with Dr. Masinter):   1)Tedit   2)TTYIN   3)Press & Interpress   Now, our approach is to introduce 16 bit JIS code representation as only JLISP access code to kana-kanji dictionary.      Current JLISP environments			JLISP based on NS Character codes   	Internal code:		ASCII			NS code	JLisp internal Code:	JIS			JIS code	File:			ASCII(JIS)		NS code	Display:		ASCII(JIS)		NS code	Press & InterPress:	ASCII(JIS)		NS code      In case of Current Interlisp-D(JLISP) environments, we must develop some JIS code base pragrams (DISPLAY, PRINTING) to handle Japanese. However, in case of JLISP based on NS Character codes, we develop only JLisp internal programs(Keybord, Kana-kanji dictionary access and conversion to NS code streams such as Display, etc). As the result of our study, we have decided that these JLisp internal codes should be flat 16 bit code(JIS) for the efficiency of dictionary access and JLISP should convert the code from JIS to NS in case of transferring data to Interlisp-D world (DISPLAY, PRINTING).   We have a plan to develop JTedit and JInterPress after we have completed JTyping/JEdit on Interlisp-D. But if Interlisp-D will introduce NS character code as internal representation, I think these programs are not required.  If you have some questions on our JLISP approach, please contact us (me, Mr.Ueda, Mr.Ikeo)   Thank you attention!      Best regards      //Nori       P.S.    I hope to continue positive communication and cooperation between your group and our group.

But we will point out that internal representation of NS code  is difefrent from FLAT 16 BIT CODE that is JIS code we mean. You know well,we have to represent NS code with special seperater characters such as Character Set Selecter Code(377-octal). This representation is  different from that of flat 16 bit code.  Our CONVERT means that in case of transferring  data encoded by flat 16 bit code to DISPLAY Streams from JLISP Typing program, we have to add some Special Character codes to original data for making  NS codes sequence.        Also, we have some ideas on internal representation of JLISP.     One is that Interlisp-D should support 2 byte string only encoding defined by NS Character encoding.      This encoding use Special Character string , that is 377 377 000. After this codes, we can express only 2 byte strings that is actually the same as Flat JIS code we means.      For example      (ai)(jin)(shi)(gan) in Japanese(kanji) code      377 377 000 [Character set ID for (ai)][code for (ai)][Character set ID for (jin)][code for (jin)][Character set ID for (shi)][code for (shi)][Character set ID for (gan)][code for (gan)]            If  Interlisp -D will employ this 2 byte string only encoding as one of NS code encoding, we can transfer data of Jlisp Typing program to the other streams  without any modification.             However,if  Interlisp -D will not employ this encoding, only support normal encording of NS code, we have to add some Special characters to data of JLISP and transfer to Interlisp -D world.     For example of  Normal encoding of NS     (ai)(jin)(shi)(gan) in Japanese(kanji) code      377 [Character set ID for (ai)][code for (ai)] 377 [Character set ID for (jin)]  [code for (jin)] 377 [Character set ID for (shi)][code for (shi)] 377 [Character set ID for (gan)]  [code for (gan)]                     We think that  best solution on NS characters encoding is that Interlisp -D should support 2 byte string only encoding as one of NS encoding in addition to the  normal encoding.      This is not our final opinion. we need futher discussion on thie issues. Please tell us your ideas.      I would like to thank you again for your advice and interesting.

That's why we need the Demo.sysout installed in the Interlisp-D to meet this requirement.  The Floattest.sysout is installed to test the Floating Point Functionality of the CPE module before setting up the system for EMI.  Since the company where we're going to do our EMI test does not have an Ethernet environment, I need the floppy tools to install both sysouts into two separate Lisp volumes.  Also, the Floattest.sysout created by Steve Purcell requires a different Initial microcode - [ivan]<lisp>Lisp10Test1BankInitial.db; therefore, the floppy may need to be modified in order to accomodate this difference.  	My mailing address is as follow:			Wendy P.

From the symptoms, it looks like the local variable NEW.NAME as a LOCALVAR instead of a SPECVAR (see p12.4 of the reference manual).  This means that the variable name was not put on the stack, so that Trillium.Printout could not see it.  I am not sure WHY this happened to you, since the default is to assume that variables are specvars (which are put on the stack).  By any chance did you compile the Trillium files with BCOMPL (which changes the default variable compilation to LOCALVARS)?Some solutions:1)  Put (DECLARE (SPECVARS NEW.NAME)) after the variable list of the PROG in Create.New.Interface.  This will insure that the variable is compiled as a SPECVAR.  Of course, it is a pain to remember to do this every place you want to use Trillium.Printout.2)  Define Trillium.Printout with a macro that generates the appropriate code.  Since the code will be in the function that Trillium.Printout is called from, there aren't any problems with LOCALVARS vs. SPECVARS.  Of course, there will be a slight space penalty --- any code which calls Trillium.Printout will be a little larger.  This may be a consideration.In general, this sort of problem comes up whenever you try EVALing arguments to an NLAMBDA function.(sorry I took so long to answer --- this place was closed up the latter half of last week)*start*00765 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 11 Jul 84 10:53 EDTFrom: Pirish.wbstSubject: Re: Lisp: Suspected compiler bugIn-reply-to: Hannaway.wbst's message of Wed, 11 Jul 84 10:31 EDTTo: LispSupport.pacc: Irish.wbst, AHenderson.pa, Hannaway.wbstPat Hannaway and I would like to know why things have changed such that we now need the DECLARE statement you suggested.  Functions compiled under versions of Carol released before June 14 worked, and those compiled under the last two releases do not.

Do you have a set of files which work when compiled in the old sysouts, but the EXACT same files don't work when compiled in new sysouts?  Are you sure that the files have not been changed?  If you have such a file or files, give me a pointer to them, and I will try it myself.Talking to AHenderson, he mentioned that some people in WBST may be trying to make trillium run faster.  Are you sure that they haven't been changing the variable declarations so that the default is to compile variables as LOCALVARS?Re: solution to your problem:Obviously, it is not practical to put in put in a declaration whereever you pass a local variable to  TRILLIUM.PRINTOUT.  I really suggest that it would be better to implement TRILLIUM.PRINTOUT with a macro.  Perhaps the easiest way would be create a macro which constucts a call to a lambda-nospread function, so that all of the local variables would be evaluated in their own environment.  This would also be faster (when running) than calling EVAL from within TRILLIUM.PRINTOUT.*start*01037 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 16 Jul 84 15:53 EDTFrom: Pirish.wbstSubject: Re: Lisp: Suspected compiler bugIn-reply-to: LispSupport.pa's message of 11 Jul 84 10:07 PDTTo: LispSupport.pacc: Pirish.wbst, Koomen.wbst, AHenderson.pa, Hannaway.wbstAfter poking around in Trillium, we (the WBST folks) found that the default has indeed been set to compile variables as LOCALVARS.  [Austin - See in TRILLIUM:   (DECLARE:  DOEVAL@LOAD (LOCALVARS . T)...]  This explains our current problem with TRILLIUM.PRINTOUT, and other problems that have cropped up lately with NLAMBDAs.  However, we still can't figure out why earlier versions of Trillium did not have this problem, since LOCALVARS is the default at least as far back as June, 1983.  The only thing we can think of is that one of the Trillium files that loads after TRILLIUM turned LOCALVARS off, and recently that file was changed.Sorry to bother you with all of this.  We will have to work it out in Trillium.Thanks,Peggy*start*01077 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: Mon, 2 Jul 84 09:56 PDTFrom: PYoung.pasaSubject: Re: Testing VMS DEIIn-reply-to: "MASINTER.PA's message of 1 JUL 84 19:41 PDT"To: MASINTER.PAcc: PYoung, Sheil.PA, LispSupport.PAWe have a VMS VAX here, recently installed, now with a private net and an 1108.

This increases the chances of crashing VMS, an event unpopular with system managers and users of large systems. We have indeed experiencedsome system crashes with DEI 6.0 and have attempted to rid DEI 6.1 of all of their causes.

I turned off the VOLUMEDISPLAY before I entered step 6.TRILLIUM.MAKESYS asks a few questions and then does a MAKESYS.  After confirming the filename (bigtrillium.sysout) the promptwindow and top level typescript window were blanked.  The cursor remained an arrow and showed swap reads, i.e. a line flashed at the top of the arrow.  I let this run from 11:30 am to 9:00 am.  I couldn't break out, although I could move the cursor.  I had to boot out.  {DSK}BigTrillium.Sysout did not exist.So, I cleaned up and loaded everything again and successfully wrote a sysout to {Aztec} in about two and a half hours, and I successfully reinitialized Lisp with that sysout.We tried to reinit two different 1100's with the new sysout.  We double checked the versions of the microcode and Lisp.Run, but Lisp would not come up.  The FTP cursor diddled its way down the blank Alto exec screen, and turned into an hourglass.  The whole 15" screen then turned white, the cursor changed to an arrow, and the systems stopped there.  The cursor could be moved, but Lisp would not appear.The sysout appears to work on the Dlions, but not on the 1100's.  It is stored as {Aztec}<Trillium>Birthday84>Beta>BigTrillium.Sysout.  Note the Beta subdirectory, as opposed to Alpha.  The file is 9800+ pages long.Thanks,Gary*start*01028 00024 US Sender: Sannella.PADate: 27 Jul 84 14:26:25 PDT (Friday)Subject: Re: Lisp: DLion configuration problemsIn-reply-to: Gocek.henr's message of 26 Jul 84 09:24 EDTTo: Gocek.henrcc: LispSupport, Boesl.henr, Goetz.henr, Evanitsky.henr, Hill.henr, PSWall.henrFrom: LispSupport.paReply-To: LispSupport.paSomething is seriously wrong here.  If the VOLUMEDISPLAY window did not show all of the volume names, then the local file system can't be interpreting the disk correctly.Have you tried formatting your disk with Othello 10.0?  That is the installation tool that we have used here.  I that there are no incompatible changes between 9.0 and 10.0, but I may be wrong.When you put DSK as the first volume on the disk, can you use the local file system?  Have you tried creating files, listing the directory, etc. to the volume DSK?  Are you sure that it is going to the disk volume DSK, rather than to a lisp coredevice DSK (i.e. do the files on {DSK} disappear if you load in a new lisp sysout?)?*start*00927 00024 US Sender: Sannella.PADate: 27 Jul 84 14:34:28 PDT (Friday)Subject: Re: Lisp and/or Trillium: MAKESYS problemsIn-reply-to: Gocek.henr's message of 26 Jul 84 10:03 EDTTo: Gocek.henrcc: LispSupport, TrilliumCore^, AHenderson, Boesl.henr, Goetz.henr, KMatysek.henr, Garnaat.henr, McFarland.henr, PSWall.henrcc: StansburyFrom: LispSupport.paReply-To: LispSupport.pa(1)  SYSOUT to {DSK}.  See my previous message about the local file system.  If the local file system is not interpreting your disk correctly, SYSOUT to DSK could not possibly work.(2)  Loading 1108 SYSOUT on 1100.  This is a known bug.  Due to the way that the stack is aligned when running Interlisp on a Dlion, it is not possible to run an 1108 sysout on an 1100.  All other translations work (1132->1108, 1132->1100, 1100->1132, 1100->1108, 1108->1132).

That was not the case when DSK was the last logical volume.  I am positive that I can store to disk now, as opposed to a coredevice.  Since this is the case, I'm not really willing to try to run Othello 10.0 to repartition my disk again.As far as I can tell, the order of the volumes is the only difference is my two attempts at configuring the 1108.  Since the problem was completely solved by changing the order, I am willing to accept the problem as a fluke.Gary
