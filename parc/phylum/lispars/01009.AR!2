This probably should be attempted only to stress the new CARET code and only when going into RS232CHAT for other reasons. (Design-Impl seems to cover it.)  -- lmm''- - - ''Date':  6 May 84 21':45 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': RS232CHAT'In-reply-to': MASINTER.PA''s message of 6 MAY 84 16':58 PDT'To': MASINTER.PA'cc': JonL.PA''Last fall, I pointed Richard at the BLINKER structure in RS232CHAT as a potential candidate for generalized carets;  what RS232CHAT needs is''1) a generalized structure with similar capability, and'2) "timeliness", meaning that the general system facility won''t be non-blocking for more than about a 4 milliseconds.''Considering all the other things I''m working on right now, I''d rather not take the time to "fix" working code.  Maybe when RS232CHAT gets a major update of some sort.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
