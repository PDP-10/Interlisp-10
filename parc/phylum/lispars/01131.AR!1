Admittedly, there are STORAGE FULL and ARRAYS FULL errors when you are really close, but those are not adequate--you''re too far gone by then.  Most of the information I want is available in a STORAGE printout somehow, but there is no programmatic interface.''The minimum requirement for me to be able to write some sort of "low space watcher" is an interface (function or set of functions) from which I can get the answers to how much space is used and how much is left, for each type of space.  The important ones seem to be litatoms, mds and array space.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 18-May-84 12':31':49Attn: Kaplan, MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Storage Formats/MgtMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
