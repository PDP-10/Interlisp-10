It sounds impressive.  ''But, LispTool.bcd is way out of dated, I will appreciate you also update this info next time on the release message.  ''Questions':'	1.	When will Interlisp run on Klamath (Mesa Version 11) machines?  I understand there will be a new microcode to go with this?  Is it worthwhile for me to set up a Klamath machine NOW and see whether we can run current Interlisp?  '	'	2.	Will Interlisp run in 3MB memory now, assuming there are people with 3/4 MB memory?'	'	Thanks very much.'	'Jerry''========================================'* Sierra/Mesa 10.0 tools can be used for installing Interlisp-D on Dandelion from inside Tajo [unchanged]':''	InstallMu.bcd		InstallMu lisp &larr; [phylum]&lt;Lisp&gt;Current&gt;Lisp.sysout'	LispTool.bcd		Window-based version of above''&lt;Lisp&gt;current '  InstallLispTool.bcd!1       95232 26-Jan-84 17':20':06 PST'  INSTALLMU.BCD!1              5632 24-Jul-83 13':20':41 PDT'  LISPTOOL.BCD!1              13312  3-Oct-83 12':12':01 PDT''-----''Date': 22 Jun 84 13':19':40 PDT (Friday)'From': Sannella.PA'Subject': Re': Carol Release of Interlisp-D now available'In-reply-to': JFung.pasa''s message of 22 Jun 84 09':11':35 PDT (Friday)'To': JFung.pasa'cc': LispSupport''1)  We are hoping that the Harmony release will be Klamath-compatible, but I wouldn''t bet my life on it.  If you try loading Carol on a Klamath machine, make sure that there is nothing else on the disk that you can''t afford to lose (I suspect that the local file system could smash important info, since it thinks that it is a 10.0 disk).''2)  I beleive that Interlisp will run with 3MB memory.

Should I just delete it, or is there a newer version that we should have?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 24-Sep-84 16':39':16</pre>
