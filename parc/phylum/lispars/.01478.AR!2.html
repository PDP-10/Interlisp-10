The same thing happens if you do a (LOADFNS ''(fn) ''sourcefile ''PROP).  This makes the file package overly conservative, and results in unnecessary recompilations.''--Tom''-----''Date': 15 Jul 84 15':02 PDT'From': Dietterich.pa'Subject': [Dietterich.pa': Lisp': LOADFNS of a fn causes file pkg to think file has changed]'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Dietterich.pa''This is not a LISP bug.
