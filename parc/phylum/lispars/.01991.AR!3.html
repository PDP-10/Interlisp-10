Also it''s probably something a new user does early on.  IWABNI it took the cedar /// syntax, but that''s not as useful.''Also, why can''t I shift-select text into the prompt window when it has the fancy T cursor?''[JDS':  declined.  It is TEdit''s policy not to patch holes in the lisp world; since TEdit uses the standard Lisp file-handling, name-recognition, and such features, it won''t handle non-Lisp syntax.''The appropriate fix is to have the Lisp filename parsers handle other syntaxes.  Then TEdit will fall in line automatically.'' Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':25':26</pre>
