How would you handle this problem with a less fortunate customer?  I would rather we had these tools shipped directly with the machines.  Most tools are simply only rumors to me.  Eg., we would desperately like to have the 10 mb equivalent of Etherwatch and PeekPup to run on our 1108''s on our 10 mb ethernet.  The only way I was able to log the booting transaction was by booting off a server 3 hops away, one of the legs of which was a 3 mb net on which I had an Alto!  I would normally try to boot off a machine on the local 10 mb net; a transaction which we have no tools to monitor.  Thanks,'''--Christopher''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-Jul-84 12':43':12</pre>
