Number: 1067Date: 10-May-84 11':33':45Submitter: NuyensSource: NuyensSubject: Spurious Bad number msg in ARformAssigned To: Attn: SannellaStatus: FixedIn/By: Problem Type: BugImpact: AnnoyingDifficulty: Frequency: OncePriority: PerhapsSystem: TextSubsystem: OtherMachine: 1100Disk: Lisp Version:  9-May-84 09':41':34Source Files: Microcode Version: 5121Memory Size: 3072File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: '["Sannella.PA" "29-Aug-84 14':52':23" Status':(Open-&gt;Fixed)]Description: I previously had a number in the number field of the AR report editor window.  I positioned to the beginning of that number, typed 3 digits followed by a space.  I then did a middle button ctrl selection of the second three digit number.  The display looked correct, but Get choked with bad number.  I ctrl selected everything after the number (couldn''t tell if there was anything) tried again.  Still lost.   Positioned to the end of the number, hit backspace 66.3 times, retyped the number and hit Get.   Won.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 14':52':23</pre>
