A version of gacha10'with backquote is available as {phylum}<lisp>fonts>gacha10.strike.  How'about moving {phylum}<lisp>fonts>gacha8.strike, gacha10.strike, and gacha12.strike to {indigo} so that the gacha fonts in core at loadup have bacquotes?'				Kelly'''--------------'LMM': I think ALL of the fonts that are DELIVERED with Interlisp-D should be put on [phylum]<Lisp>Fonts>  and modified to contain the backquote character. ''As a side note, [phylum]<Lisp>Fonts> should NOT contain any fonts which are NOT delivered. We''ve delivered Gacha/Timesroman and Helvetica in the past-- there are a bunch of other fonts which do not occur on any of our printers and are thus suspect. Also, there is a separate AR to convert to STAR fonts instead of ALTO fonts, which would give a different approach to this problem (the STAR fonts have backquote and other characters in them.)Workaround: Test Case: (BOUT T 96) in any window with dspfont a gacha font.Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-May-84 16':22':23Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm 8Mar': extended for all fonts]System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: FontsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
