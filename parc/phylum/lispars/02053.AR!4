I button DELIVER, the window closes & nothing is sent.  I tried some very trivial messages with the same effect so I assume LAFITE has gotten into some kind of odd state.  I also tried (LAFITE ''OFF) followed by (LAFITE ''ON) which didn''t help.  This isn''t (I believe) the same problem as I reported about other undeliverable mail--there the window stayed open & wouldn''t deliver.  Here, the window closes & the deliver would look like it was successfull if it weren''t so immediate.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 15-Sep-84 14':12':54
