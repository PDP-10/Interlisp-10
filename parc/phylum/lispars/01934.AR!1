The documentation, and comparison with the DREVERSE example - (SMASH . PPE) - suggest that the correct template is simply PPE.  However, this is rejected as an invalid template.  (! CALL . PPE) is acceptable, but on retrieval becomes plain PPE.  Thus my code has to kludge it back into shape between GET and SET.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
