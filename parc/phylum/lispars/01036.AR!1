The printout upon exit also prints  "<fnname> = ...",  which is frequently hard to distinguish from the lines printed for each argument value.  Suggest a fontshift on the exit-line function name (for WBREAK -- not concerned about Teletype-level breaking), or some other symbol to distinguish the value-return line.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-May-84 17':25':59Attn: BurtonAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Break PackageMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: 5121Memory Size: 3584File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
