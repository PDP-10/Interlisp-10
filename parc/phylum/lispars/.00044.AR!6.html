This means if I change the margin bar for one TEdit window, the margin bar in the other TEdit window changes its setting as well (since they obviously point to the same Lisp object).''This is very, very bad news and should be changed tuit suite.  TEdit windows are (conceptually) independent editors.  It causes the user much confusion and frustration to have this little element of non-independence stuck in there.''Frank''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 18':57':36Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
