Things work fine, except that'the Dandelions keep send packets at a rate near 1 per second.'We have reason to think that it is vainly trying to locate some'sort of XNS server that of course does not exist.  While the'PDP-11 will discard this packet (it discards anything that is'not a PUP) it does inflate our statistics on network usage,'and otherwise bollix up any attempts to monitor the network.'It would be helpful if we could turn this junk off.  I assume'we can just redefine one or two functions to return NIL.  Can'you suggest what ones they might be?  It might be useful to'provide a documented way to turn this stuff off, since other'installations may also have a PUP-only enviornment.'-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Apr-84 18':10':30Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: NS ProtocolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
