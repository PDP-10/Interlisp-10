In particular, SETFILEPTR causes the caret in the associated window to move, whereas the other non-writing operations, including GETFILEPTR, GETEOFPTR, READ, READC, PEEKC, and BIN do not.  I''ll leave you to judge whether this is what should happen --- I have no strong feelings one way or the other..''---Jim ''-----''Date': 20 MAR 84 22':07 PST'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': AR 180 (Tedit SETFILEPTR move caret)'To':   LISPSUPPORT'cc':   ROACH, DESRIVIERES, SYBALSKY''     I personally would prefer SETFILEPTR not move the caret.  I have'quite a few hooks into my TEDIT.READTABLE that use SETFILEPTR with'read & print operations and it is fairly awkward looking and seemingly'slower to have the caret move around in the Tedit window while my'functions do their computing.  I already know how to "SETCARETPTR"'by using TEDIT.SETSEL.'				Kelly''-----''Date':  3 APR 84 13':50 PST'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': Renewed plea that AR180 be fixed.'To':   LISPSUPPORT''     If letting you know a user''s priorities will influence the TEDIT'debugging effort in any way, I would like to renew my plea that AR180'be fixed.  This is the bug concerning TEDIT''s moving the caret around'when you do SETFILEPTR on a textstream and remains my #1 complaint.'It seriously affects the behaviour of commands like DEL, ^P, and ^N in'<LISPUSERS>EMACS.DCOM.  Quote from Brian Smith':''     "For example, ^P and ^N take a long time ... they display the'caret at the end or beginning of the line they are moving to, which'suggests an extra re-display is happening."''David Wallace has noted this behaviour to me, and Jim DesRivieres sent'you AR180.  The Difficulty field of this AR is marked Easy, but the'bug has been around for some time now, and hasn''t always existed'(you introduced it when you fixed another of SETFILEPTR''s bugs).  I''m'hoping that this bug will get some needed atention.''				Kelly'-----''Date':  4 Apr 84 11':36 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': AR 180':  further Roach flame'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 4 Apr 84 11':05':48 PST (Wednesday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Sybalsky.pa''FIXED.
