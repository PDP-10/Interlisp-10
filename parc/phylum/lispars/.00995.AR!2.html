The list of \DEDITWINDOWS is no longer reset by order of creation.'["sheil" "12-Sep-84 23':06':18" Status':(Open-&gt;Fixed) Disposition':]Description: If one has two DEdit processes (e.g. by having called DEdit thru the inspector while another DEdit is active) and exits the older one first, one gets a "Shouldnt" DEDITDSPS tangled" msg when trying to exit the other DEdit.''The reason is that Dedit RESETVARs (in GETEDITW) the variable \DEDITWINDOWS, which is a list of active DEdits. Thus, exiting out of order throws away the context for any younger process.''This is related to the older bug reported in AR 849, which was already fixed in Carol.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sheilEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 23':06':19</pre>
