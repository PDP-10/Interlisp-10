Mesa 11.0 (or Klamath) is a new incompatible Pilot disk format, which SDD is going to release in September.  The Harmony release HAS to be Mesa 11.0 compatible, so we are changing over now.''If you use a Dolphin or Dorado, or if you never have a DLion local file system volume on your disk, then this does not effect you.  You can load and run the latest <lispcore>next> sysouts as usual.''However, if you want to use the Dlion local file system with the lastest <lispcore>next> sysouts, then you will have to update your Dlion to Mesa 11.0.  This involves re-partitioning your disk, which will destroy any data on it, so be sure to save all information stored on your local disk.  (Note': The Carol release (on {eris}<lisp>current>) is still Mesa 10.0 compatible, if you want to save local file system data before switching to Mesa 11.0.)''=====''How to update your Dlion to Mesa 11.0':''The instructions are similar to those given in {eris}<lisp>current>GettingStarted.tedit, except that there is a different procedure for Booting Othello 11.0 from the net [do a 6-boot; get MP 1111; press Alt-B until 6 is displayed] and the .othello files are on {eris}<lispcore>CM>.''Unfortunately, the Lisp Installation Tool has not yet been upgraded to Mesa 11.0.  There are three ways to load Interlisp onto your Dlion':'''(1)  From Othello 11.0, use the .othello files':''[eris]<lispcore>CM>InstallLisp.othello'[eris]<lispcore>CM>InstallFull.othello'[eris]<lispcore>CM>InstallDemo.othello'''(2)  There is a modified version of Othello 11.0, called "Hello 11.0", which includes useful commands for Interlisp-D users, such as a command for copying sysouts between logical volumes.  This is stored as the boot file [eris]<lispcore>mesa>HelloDlion.boot.  There is some documentation in the file [eris]<lispcore>mesa>Hello.tedit.''Note':  Hello is automatically stored on your disk by the .othello command files': [eris]<lispcore>cm>Partition10Lisp.othello, Partition29Lisp.othello, and Partition43Lisp.othello.'''(3)  There is a tool which can be used from within the Tajo environment to fetch and install Interlisp sysouts':  [eris]<lispcore>mesa>InstallLisp.bcd.  There is documentation in [eris]<lispcore>mesa>InstallLisp.doc''-----''From': masinter.pa'Date':  6-Aug-84 16':42':34 PDT'Subject': Re': {eris}<lispcore>next> sysouts updated to Mesa 11.0 (Klamath)'In-reply-to': Sannella''s message of 6 Aug 84 13':13 PDT'To': LispSupport''You might note that SDD usually provides a program which automatically converts one release format to the next, and that we should be ashamed for not doing so, except perhaps in this initial configuration.''Secondly': the directions for booting Othello 11.0 differ from location to location (it depends on what exactly is stored on the local boot server.) I will send a message to LispFriends^ telling them about it...'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 15-Aug-84 15':13':12Attn: Sannella.PAAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: AbsolutelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
