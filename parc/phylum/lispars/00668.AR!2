If we had a program that would read Intepress 'files, and from that, generate a Lisp program which actually created 'that file, we could proceed toward some pretty interesting and general 'utilities; e.g., we could take the diagrams tht were generated by Star 'and move them back into a paramaterizable and editable format. I suggest'this as an AR rather than an idea for, say, Ken Feueurman, because I 'think that there are probably some capabilities that are needed in the 'intepress generation code that aren''t there. In fact, it would be best 'if the interpress reader generated DIG code, e.g., so that you could 'then run the program on the display. (It is almost necessary to do that 'if you are going to display an interpress document in a window smaller 'than the document.)'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalsky.paEdit-Date: 12-Apr-84 17':41':11Attn: kaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: Priority: PerhapsStatus: WishProblem Type: Source Files:
