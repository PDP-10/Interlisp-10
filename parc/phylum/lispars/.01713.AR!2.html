DLisp Version: Description: 'I can consistently repeat the error': copyfile from sumex to safe, then try to read the file (load, compile, etc.).  The message comes up "attempt to operate on a broken file.  Do not proceed until the problem has been resolved" and Leaf breaks with error 1015.   The stack shows DOPMAP inside of  SKIPSEPRS inside of UPDATEFILEMAP.  I gave a full report of this to Schmidt in mid-May.  (As you might guess, UPDATEMAPFLG is T.)'''- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - -'The third problem, about PUPFTP and End-of-line conventions, is a little less clear to me what the problem/symptom is. Perhaps more details about what doesn''t work will be forthcoming.''The report said "Schmidt suggested using PUPFTP with end-of-line set to Transparent. However, it does not appear that PUPFTP sets the version number correctly. When I move over a new file and do INFILEP, I get the old version.  (DIR doesn''t work, so I have no easy way of finding out what is really there.)" ''This leads me to believe that there is (a) some problem with DIR, and (b) some problem with INFILEP or PUPFTP, but exactly what, I''m not sure.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 27-Jul-84 14':58':47Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: PUP ProtocolsMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
