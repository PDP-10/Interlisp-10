Number: 405Date: 31-Mar-84 13':31':40Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Roach.paSubject: Tedit shouldn''t give "Edit Window [Inactive]" title to titleless windowsLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 30 Mar 84 10':52 PST'From': Roach.pa'Subject': TEDIT handling of titleless windows'To': LISPSUPPORT'cc': Roach.pa''     Attn': Sybalsky, Nuyens     Impact': Annoying'     Although not documented, from the TEDIT code I infer that the user is allowed to assign his own titles to TEDIT windows.  On my interpretation, this should include titleless windows.  However, if you Quit a titleless TEDIT window, TEDIT will give the window the title "Edit Window [Inactive]" which is not the behaviour you get if you are using your own window title.  It would be better to treat titleless windows on an equal basis with user titled windows.'     I am able to patch around this by using a TEDIT.QUITFN window property, but the quitfn requires that you know some fairly internal details of TEDIT''s code.'					Kelly''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sybalsky, NuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
