Several times I have bombed with file system problems and run around looking for someone to look at the state of the machine.  No one has ever been willing to take responsibility for this task.  I have tried to debug the code by myself.  While I haven''t found any major solutions, I can point out a number of bugs in the DLIONFS code I have discovered this way.  It seems like a knowledgeable person doing this task might gain a lot of valuable insight just by looking at various problems when they occur.''2)  Assign someone to take a day and write a 4-page memo on the structure of the DLion file system and to comment the code as best as possible.  I would be willing to track down problems to the best of my ability.  But I have a hard time making heads or tails of the code as it now stands.

The sysout I''m starting from is found on {Rosebowl}&lt;lisp&gt;carol&gt;full.sysout.  After that I load {phylum}&lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt;DLIONFS.DCOM.  Next, I call (MKDIR ''DSK).
