Unfortunately, TEDIT takes that as a cursor move command, so you lose your old cursor position in the process of regaining the editor''s attention.  It would be nice if TEDIT would simply TOTOPW itself without moving the old cursor location on the first click when re-entering its window.''			- Michel''-----''Date': 20 Apr 84 16':14 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': AR 149 FIXED'To': LispSupport'cc': Sybalsky.pa''TEdit no longer changes selection when you button in a window--just moves the TTY.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':37':59Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
