A customer and I are especially interested in "A sysout generated on an 1108 cannot be installed on an 1100."''Is this still a Known Problem with Carol?  Why is this not possible?  ''Thank you very much,''Lorraine ''-----''Date': 28 Jun 84 17':08 PDT'From': masinter.pa'Subject': Re': Carol Release Notes'In-reply-to': Kiewiet.pasa''s message of 28 Jun 84 16':50 PDT'To': Kiewiet.pasa'cc': vanMelle, LispSupport''This is still a Known Problem.  The problem is that the microcode on the 1100 (and the 1100 alone) requires that stack frames be quad-word aligned. The 1100 and the 1132 keep stack frames quadword aligned. However, the 1108 does not. Thus, while you can move sysouts''1100 -&gt; 1132'1100 -&gt; 1108'1100 -&gt; 1100'1132 -&gt; 1100'1132 -&gt; 1108'1132 -&gt; 1132'1108 -&gt; 1108'1108 -&gt; 1132''you cannot move them''1108 -&gt; 1100'''There *is* a workaround, I believe, if the situation is desparate. It involves some patching the system with READSYS; the discussion of the workaround and the request to solve the problem is in an AR, which may also contain more details for the workaround. If you can''t find it, I think vanMelle was the one who probed the problem.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Jun-84  9':46':53Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Stack and InterpreterMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Very HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: FatalPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
