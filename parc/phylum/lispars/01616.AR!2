The latest versions of services should do a much better job of printing bitmaps. There were some known problems in the Interlisp-D code for handling large bitmaps, however, which will not be fixed until the Harmony release. ''The ROTATION arg currently works (for multiple of 90 degrees, of course), but there are still some glitches in the code.'''["masinter" "26-Aug-84 16':16':44" Attn': Status':(Open->Fixed) Impact':(Serious->Moderate) Disposition':]Description: 'Date':  9 Jul 84 16':06 PDT'From': TBigham.es'Subject': Lisp': NS printing (COURIER.OPEN & HARDCOPYW)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': TBigham.es'Lisp-System-Date': 21-Jun-84 10':50':28'Machine-Type': Dolphin'...''1. I haven''t been able to get the ROTATE argument in HARDCOPYW to work.  When printing to an Interpress 8044 the output defaults to Landscape if the image is very large and altering the ROTATION argument does not shift the image. Have I missed something here?  Or does the 8044 not support rotation?''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 26-Aug-84 16':16':47
