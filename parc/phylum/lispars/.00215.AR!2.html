SInce the bar comes up 38 units wide, if the window is less than 38 units wide the right margin cannot be reset.''Frank''PS.  What are those units on the margin bar anyway?''-----''Date': 19 Mar 84 17':34 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': TEdit': TEditmenu margin setter'To': TEditSupport'cc': vanMelle.pa'TEdit-System-Date':  2-Mar-84 16':54':27'Lisp-System-Date': 15-Mar-84 00':13':18'Machine-Type': Dorado''1.  If the right margin is set beyond the right margin of the window, I find I can''t shrink it back.  I have to reshape the window wider so that I can get hold of the right edge and drag it in.''2.  I find it hard to move the left margins leftward.  Seems like I have to grab the edge and move it rightward before I can move it left.''3.  I see no way to specify left margins but leave the right margin "floating", something I would do if I were allowed to.  Having non-floating (i.e. fixed) right margin is a pain because it forces your editing window to be at least that wide in order to be able to see all your text.  Also, once there are margins at all, I don''t see how to get rid of them all, unless I can find a paragraph in my document with no margins and do a SHOW.''	Bill'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalskyEdit-Date: 16-Jul-84 15':37':55</pre>
