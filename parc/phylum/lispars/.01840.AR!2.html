Number: 1840Date: 14-Aug-84 13':26':09Submitter: RoachSource: RoachSubject: Can''t &uarr;D when CAR/CDRERR = CDR because NOCLEARSTKLST has bad formAssigned To: MasinterAttn: Status: FixedIn/By: Problem Type: BugImpact: ModerateDifficulty: Frequency: EverytimePriority: PerhapsSystem: Language SupportSubsystem: Stack and InterpreterMachine: 1108Disk: Lisp Version:  7-Aug-84 15':57':18Source Files: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 3071File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: '["Masinter" "21-Aug-84 14':31':20" Assigned% To': Attn': Status':(Open-&gt;Fixed)]Description: Apparently, the variable NOCLEARSTKLST is a dotted list whose CAR''s are stack ptrs and whose last CDR is the atom NOBIND (pretty susipicious).  When I have CAR/CDRERR = CDR, I am unable to &uarr;D because there is a form containing (FMEMB X NOCLEARSTKLST) on RESETFORMS.  FMEMB will break because of the dotted list passed to it.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 14':31':21</pre>
