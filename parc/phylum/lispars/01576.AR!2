In then seems to be impossible to change that text so that it displays in another font.  E.g., if you select TIMESROMAN, Size 10, select the text, and then APPLY, nothing happens.''If you open up a new Tedit window, copyselect the text into that, and then APPLY the fontchange to Timesroman 10 in that window, you get the proper behavior.''--RonWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalskyEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 17':06':01
