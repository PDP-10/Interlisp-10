'Page 18.31 of the new manual says "if the current process already owns the lock...WITH.MONITOR is a noop."  Does this mean that the FORMS are not executed in this case, or just that no attempt is made to manipulate the lock if it is already held? '. . . 'This has got to be a bug in the documentation; I''m sure it means that the  call OBTAIN.MONITOR.LOCK implicit in the WITH.MONITOR macro is a noop.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
