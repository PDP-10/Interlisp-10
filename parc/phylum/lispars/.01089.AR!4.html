But Mitch''s name is so long that there isn''t room enough to add anyone else.  This problem also pops up under the System/Subsystem section "Storage formats/Mgt" where the names listed in LispARFields.txt are "vanMelle.pa, Kaplan.pa, Jonl.pa", a phrase over 10 characters longer than the allotment.''I''d like to say about some fixes that such-and-such a bug is fixed in the version on &lt;LispCore&gt;Library&gt; as of the date, say, " 9-May-94"; but the In/By field isn''t big enough to hold even the directoryname.''-- JonL --''-----''Date': 11 May 84 09':21 PDT'From': Sannella.pa'Subject': Re': AR submitted on limited length of Attn and In/By fields'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 11 May 84 03':16 PDT'To': JonL.pa'cc': Sannella.pa''This is a valid complaint --- however, it is not going to be fixed until all of the AR tools are in lisp, so we don''t have to deal with adobe (bletch) any more.''In the mean time, here is what I have been doing':''Attn': field --- I generate the reports for each person by looking in the Attn': field for the first 4 chars of their name.  Therefore, "Attn': vanM, Kapl, Jonl" will work just like "Attn': vanMelle.pa, Kaplan.pa, Jonl.pa".  Kludge, Kludge.''I have found the "In/By" field to be generally useless.  I would put info about where the bug has been fixed (source file, date) in the Disposition field.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 14':54':38</pre>
