Press <CTRL> key down, left button mouse at top-left corner of document, move mouse into scroll bar and middle button down to end of document, right button mouse at end of document, let <CTRL> key up.  The inverted portions of the Tedit window, (your CTRL-selction), do not match up with the text.  (Looks like it matches up with what the text looked like before you scrolled.)'						Kelly''-----''Date':  2 Apr 84 11':59 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': AR 362': CTRL-sel & Scrolling causes bad inverted text'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 29 Mar 84 12':04':04 PST (Thursday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Sybalsky.pa, TeditSupport.pa''Is FIXED for the next release.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':35':39Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
