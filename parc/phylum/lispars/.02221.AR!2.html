We''ve noticed a "deficiency" in the CHAT feature that sends the'CHAT.DISPLAYTYPE information to the remote host.  When you first CHAT to our TOPS-20 system,  CHAT establishes the terminal type so that "clearscreen" and cursor addressing work properly  (in our case as a DM2500).  If you logout or close the window (i.e. CLOSE the CHAT connection),  the next time'you CHAT,  the TOPS-20 system no longer knows your terminal type.  You can "re-initialize" by reshaping the window, in which case the height &amp; width of the virtual terminal are handled correctly during calls to EMACS.  Of course the TOPS-20 again knows that you''re on a DM2500.   If you merely tell the TOPS-20 EXEC that your terminal type is a DM2500,  something about the window size isn''t set properly, and EMACS will tell you that "your terminal height/'width may cause problems".''' Things work as expected when you first boot the system ...  but subsequent CHAT connections in the PRIMARY CHAT WINDOW screw up as described. Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Sep-84 15':58':29</pre>
