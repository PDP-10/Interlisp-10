This is not in microcode either on the Dandelion or Dorado. This shows up in spy stats quite a bit. I think the divide can be avoided.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  7-May-84  8':29':23Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: OtherMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 8191File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: LLFAULT
