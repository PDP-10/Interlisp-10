It would be very useful to be able to shift-select program code into a TEdit buffer, in PP''ed form, instead of as one llong string, for documentation purposes.

Also the formatting info is probably wrong if you move to another window since it is right margin dependent. Solving both these problems together is very hard for the current crufty PP.''But it''s not unreasonable. Just unlikely. I''ll put it on the wish list.''Beau'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-Jul-84  9':31':35Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
