This causes no end of headache, and causes people to not comment on many occassions.  There might already be an AR on this, but I''d like to see a better comment facility whereby the interpreter and compiler actually know about comments rather than treating them as fns or macros, thereby allowing comments almost anywhere.  Perhaps reading comments could cause a bit to be set somewhere that would cause the interpreter/compiler to toss the comment.  Alternatively, they could look at the structures that they are manipulating and take appropriate action.''   I find documenting Lisp programs internally to be a monumental task at the moment, which causes a separation of doc and code that is contrary to what I understand to be the Interlisp-D philosophy.''	-- Rich' 'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 17':02':49
