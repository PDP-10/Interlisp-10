The current documentation on the "Remote Boot!" command says': "The sysout on the source volume must be ''untouched'', i.e., the source volume must never have been started."''I have changed the subject of this AR to "Want to be able to "Remote Boot!" sysouts that have been started", Attn': JFung.pasa.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 17-Jul-84 21':25':27Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: vanMelleIn/By: Carolversion 6/1/84Disposition: Bill vanMelle provided the reasoning for this.  This will be closed when AR 379 (make dlion vmem extend gracefully) is fixed by Bill.  The correct "installation procedure" now is for users loading sysouts from floppies, to go into LispInstallationTool before doing any lisp stuff, and do a SetVMem command setting VMem to the highest size as possible.  All these are documented on the new 1108UG for Carol release. //JFung.  System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Virtual MemoryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
