(1) The ringbells "feature" in PROMPTFORWORD only is active while PROMPTFORWORD has the tty.  Personally, I would say this is not the problem, since I think the ringbells hack in PROMPTFORWORD is of dubious worth, and often an annoyance.  (2) Tedit prompts in an obscure place (the prompt window), far from the scene of the action.''[mjs 4/5/84':  john claims that all prompting is now done in a small prompt window on top of each Tedit window]Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':42':21Attn: Assigned To: SybalskyIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
