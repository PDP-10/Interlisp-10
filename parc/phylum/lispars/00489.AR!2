I.e., I like the model of the "List" 'command on IFS''s better.'''Since the question came up in the context of a DELETE, it might'be worth asking if some re-constituted DEL command could be devised; in'particular, it would supply no "defaults" for extensions, versions etc.''-----''Date':  8 MAR 84 18':54 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': More DIR bugs and glitches'To':   LispSupport''DIR MACH*.  'lists only the source files and not the .DCOMs''DIR MACH*.DCOM'lists only the .DCOMs and not the sources''But . . .''DIR (MACH*. + MACH*.DCOM)'lists each .DCOM file twice in addition to the source files'''Also, the manual doesn''t say anything about DIRECTORY being limited in'Interlisp-D, yet the TRIMTO and OLDVERSIONS commands don''t work''Finally, when the filename-plus-version is longer than about 20 characters,'an extra line is inserted before printing the "other" data such as'creationdate.  Why?  The ttywindow here is amply wide to accommodate many'more characters.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Apr-84 11':35':12Attn: JellinekAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Performance ToolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
