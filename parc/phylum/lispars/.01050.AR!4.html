However, this wipes out the whole purpose of the jumping DMT on the dark screen.  The whole concept of the jumping DMT is to save the lifetime of the CRT.  This exist to all workstations, Alto, Dlophin, Dlion. ''The Install tool with the Fugue6 version has an enlarged window size, about half screen size.  This should help users locating their cursor.''-----''Date': 10 May 84 12':32':48 PDT (Thursday)'From': Sannella.PA'Subject': Re': AR 1050': InstallLispTool should change background from black (so can see cursor)'In-reply-to': JFung.pasa''s message of 10 May 84 11':40':15 PDT (Thursday)'To': JFung.pasa'cc': LispSupport''I am afraid that I was not clear --- what I want is for the background to change to gray when the installlisptool or the profiletool or the diagnosticstool is brought up, and changed back to black when all of these tools have been Quit-ed.
