I think in general the hourglass cursor is appropriate when the MOUSE isn''t available, but probably not at other times. It is egocentric to think that, while you''re waiting for LAFITE to turn on, you don''t want to do anything else.''[There may be other instances of violation of this principle which should get separate ARs]''...'-----''Date': 23 Mar 84 12':38 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 280': LAFITE(ON) shouldn''t reset cursor'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 23 Mar 84 12':14':33 PST (Friday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa''Indeed.  The most serious violator of this principal that comes to mind is Tedit (at startup when it reads the file, during Put, Get, Hardcopy etc).
