It left the background a motley mixture of the "vanilla" background and the "crufty" background I happened to have at the time of calling WINDOWWORLD.  The "mixture" seemed to be along the lines of where there were pre-existing windows.''But the Lafite Status window just "disappeared".  I tried (LAFITE ''ON NIL) afterwards, and nothing happened.  Finally, (LAFITE ''OFF) followed by (LAFITE ''ON NIL) brought it back.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
