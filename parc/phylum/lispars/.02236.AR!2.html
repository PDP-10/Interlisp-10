''If we made bitmaps be 2 dimensional 1-bit arrays, we could probably also put bitmaps out into extended space (once ''real virtual space'' was exhausted).''This is actually not too cockeyed, and might let us advertise, e.g., a 48 bit virtual address space.''Larry'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 24-Sep-84 14':42':42</pre>
