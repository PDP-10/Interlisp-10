It is filed at [Rose]<Lisp>Carol>Installation>Prometheus.script''2) a new LispInstallationTool(LIT) filed at [Rose]<lisp>Carol>Installation>LispInstallationTool.bcd>. '''The following reflects updates since the version of Jan. 26 1984.''*** AR FIXED':''137	Prometheus Script wrong for 10MB disk'177	MP915 with large control stroe.'279	Install Tool should allow booting non-Lisp volumes'394	Embedded space in Domain in user.cm doesn''t show.'506	Installing Sysout from Vax/DEI to Dlion caused a MP 915'676	Installing lisp sysout from DEC 2060 (workaround provided)'754	Starting Online Diagnostics (from bouncing box) caused MP 915'820	Installing sysout from Unix file server. (bug fixed on Unix side)'822	Bogus file syntax when talking to Vax/DEI file server'862	Remote-boot command has been renamed to Copy VMem command.'864	Spelling errors in Help! general doc		'811, 1014, 450	Want to boot sysouts which have been started after copied.'1048	Install Tool won''t install 7000 page sysout on 8000 page volume'''*** AR DECLINED':''361	Ignores NSFile and PUPFile entries in user.cm'560	Updating diagnostics on the Installation Utility'861	Installation Utility should have "Start Install Lisp Tool"'''--------------------------------------------''NON-AR CHANGES':''	-- LIT and ProfileTool windows have been enlarged to about half-screen size.  This is to aid better locating of the mouse cursor.'	-- New twiddler graphic (Ying-Yang) for Copy VMem window.'	-- the tool dynamically refreshes the Vol-Size, Free-Size & VMem size information.'	-- "Start Volume" command has been renamed to "Boot" command.'	-- "File Server" parameter has been renamed to "Device".'	-- A floppy-file entry is added into the ProfileTool to allow setting of floppy''s file name.'	-- The STOP key has been added to the keyborad interface.  Hitting STOP key from bouncing box will boot your "Lisp" volume.'	'	'--------------------------------------------'''NOTES':''LISP INSTALLATION TOOL':''	1.	The bcd file has been renamed to LispInstallationTool.bcd from InstallLispTool.bcd.  Internal users using InitialCommand should make this modification.''	2.	Booting of non-lisp volume is supported.  The ONLY restriction is booting with a name of "daignositics" is inhibited.  This is to prevent customers from using the "tajo" features.  Internal users are advised not to use the "diagnostics" name, but instead name it as Tajo or User volume.'	'3.	Hitting STOP key should imply you have a Lisp volume installed first else you are likely to get some MP code.''4.	The new local disk volume DSK is not "mesa-compatible" at this release, hence no mesa and lisp files can coexist on this volume.  '''PROFILE TOOL':'	1.	Using Profile Tool will DESTROY your user.cm file.'	'	2.	Setting Password entry is not advised on "shared" machines.'		'--------------------------------------------''KNOWN PROBLEMS':''The DSK volume will NOT appear in your Volume Menu in the LIT window.''--------------------------------------------''ACTION REQUESTS':''Bug-reports, suggestions and commnets are welcome.
