TEDIT.SHOWSEL(TXT ON NIL) could do a normalize caret.  Since it is not obvious that this behaviour would always be correct, maybe ONFLG should take ON, OFF and NORMALIZE.  Alternately, a NORMALIZEFLG would provide for the full combinatorial magnificence of the choices.''[JDS': Declined--there''s already a function that will normalize the caret, if that''s what you want.]Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 13':28':49</pre>
