Personal experience and advice from others indicates that a system is highly unreliable unless a (HARDRESET) is performed soon after a stack overflow.  Obviously, it would be desirable to handle stack overflow tidily.  Lacking this, it would be safest to perform the (HARDRESET) automatically.  Stack overflows are, after all, quite common during LISP software development.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 17':27':48</pre>
