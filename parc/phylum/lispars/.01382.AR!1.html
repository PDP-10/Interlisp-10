That is, I''ll be Dediting a fn, I select an sexpr of the fn and use Dedit''s BREAK button.  Dedit installs BREAK1 correctly, but when I exit, someone always manages to do a "FooFn UNBROKEN".  Why does this happen?  And how to I avoid it?  It''s not really obvious how to get out of this state.  Also seems to apply only to certain fns.  I can''t even reliably cause this to happen.  It just /seems/ to happen every so often.  Anyone else seen this?''-- DMR -- '''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-Jun-84 11':58':19Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
