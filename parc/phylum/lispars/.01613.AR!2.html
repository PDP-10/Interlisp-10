Number: 1613Date: 10-Jul-84 15':36':50Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Burton.paSubject: New strategy to determine window contents after reshape in RESHAPEBYREPAINTFNLisp Version: Description: 'Date':  3 Jul 84 18':06 PDT'From': Burton.pa'Subject': different strategy to determine window contents after reshape'To': LispSupport, lispfriends&uarr;''I changed RESHAPEBYREPAINTFN (the default reshaping function) to be more reasonable about which dimensions get added when a window is made larger.  Previously, the new was given to the right and top.  This was wrong in the situation that the object being viewed was against the upper right corner since you got whitespace instead of the part of the object that was out of the window to the bottom and left.  In addition, it was unintuitive in the case where the lower left corner was grabbed and moved out.  The new behavior will display the part of the object in the direction of the expansion (if the opposite side is the same in screen coordinates) and only display white space beyond the extent if the extent is fully visible. ''This entailed adding an argument to RESHAPEBYREPAINTFN which will be documented shortly.
