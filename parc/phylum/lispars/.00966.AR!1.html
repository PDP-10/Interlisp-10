''I seem to remember a wish like this -- consistent convention for signaling sub-menus -- being raised long ago, without resolution.''-- JonL --''Lisp System Date': 23-Apr-84 14':14':37'Machine': Dolphin (BuickoSaurus)'Microcode version': 24,1'Memory size': 7000'Frequency': Intermittent'Impact': Annoying (VERY!)''-----''Date': 24 Apr 84 11':07 PST'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Need consistent convention for signaling sub-menus'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 24 Apr 84 10':36 PST'To': JonL.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa, LispCore&uarr;.pa''While you''re at it, you might mention that Richard implemented such a consistent convention (the SmallTalk, slide to the right) in the menu package. The problem is that noone is using it, and for horizontally structured menus, it doesnt work.''I tried converting DEdit (whose vertical menu is appropriate) to use Richard''s code, but it didnt support all the bells and whistles that I''ve wired into DEdit, so I gave Richard a feature request list and deferred it.''I think that standardizing on whatever goes in the menu package is the best solution, but it''s unreasonable to expect it to cover all the different styles we currently have implemented immediately.''Beau''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  4-May-84  9':47':21Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
