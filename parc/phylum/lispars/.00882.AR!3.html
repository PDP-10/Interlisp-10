That appeared to work fine.  I then finished the message and tried to deliver it.  Low and behold, where I had moved the text now had instead the characters " caught it, w" (same number of characters), which was part of the text that was roughly at the end of the message at the time I had done the original move. ''JDS 5/4':  Perhaps a problem with not clearing the insertion piece during MOVE?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 11':49':55</pre>
