After some timeout, lisp starts'calling RINGBELLS every few seconds until the user supplies a name and'password.  A one-shot ringbells might be okay.  '	The most common case is that a user leaves a lisp starting up and'goes next door to do something else while waiting.  He then returns half'an hour later, and is beaten silly with a rolodex by the others in the office'who have been driven screaming bonkers by the ringbells tune.'	Please change this.'--Christopher'-------''End of messageWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JonL.paEdit-Date:  4-Sep-84 21':10':30
