If it is T, the initial setting, then the next message is displayed after a delete only if it is undeleted and unexamined, the usual case of a GetMail.  The only perturbation to this is if the next message is from self, then it is implicitly examined (if LAFITEIFFROMMETHENSEENFLG is true), in which case Lafite pretends the message is unexamined if the next message not from self is unexamined.''There were versions of Lafite for a few months where this was not true of LAFITEDISPLAYAFTERDELETEFLG=T due to this problem with messages from self; in those, the next message was displayed if it was undeleted, independent of whether it was examined.''	Bill''-----''Date': 20 Mar 84 18':48 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': AR 187  auto-display-after-delete suggestion'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 18 Mar 84 21':12 PST'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': kaplan.pa, lafitesupport.pa''Actually, I do have LAFITEDISPLAYAFTERDELETEFLG set to T, but I think I now see the crucial aspect of my environment that is making it not do what I want.''I frequently read mail from home using the GV terminal service.

These message then get auto-displayed after deleting a preceding message, even though I don''t necessarily want that to happen.''Is there any way of getting more accurate information about what has been seen from the GV?  When I delete a message in the GV, it does seem to get marked in a way that Lisp can detect.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-May-84 13':00':03
