That way, when we get a bug report with the makesys date, we can trace it back to something that we can identify.  Currently, if a user does his own makesys on top of ours, we lose track.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-Jun-84 10':01':56Attn: Kaplan, SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Release ProcedureMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
