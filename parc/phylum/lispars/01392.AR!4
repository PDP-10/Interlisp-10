In Harmony, the interpress DRAWLINE will probably take mica coordinates, not screen points, as is the current hack.   In subsequent releases, the scale of the stream will be user-settable.''2.  I have been reworking the Grapher so that it will work properly on all devices, plus adding a couple of new capabilities.  He may want to piggyback on top of the work that I''ve been doing.''--Ron''----''In harmony, (DISPLAYGRAPH graph stream clip/reg trans) will put the graph on stream (which can be any image stream) with coordinates translated to trans.  Some streams might also implement clip/reg as a clipping region.  This is primarily an efficiency hack for the display.''HARDCOPYGRAPH will open an imagestream, do the DISPLAYGRAPH of a graph or the graph from a window, then close the stream.  (HARDCOPYGRAPH  window) will send the graph directly to {LPT}.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: KaplanEdit-Date: 15-Sep-84 03':24':55
