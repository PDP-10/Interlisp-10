If you have to *actually* build the files some other way, then don''t pretend that you can do it with a command file.''It used to be there was one single file MakeLispFloppies.DOC that had several sections, with documentation on how to build various floppies. I''m not sure why you went to change it to be some kind of ".cm" file when the ".cm" file doesn''t work.''You need to build files that build Trident Prometheus installation floppies too. ''I urge you to go back and create a MakeLispFloppies.DOC which has all of the info on how to create all of the floppies associated with the harmony release, and we will delete the bogus command files.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
