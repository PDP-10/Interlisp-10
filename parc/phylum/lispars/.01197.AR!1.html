This is because there isn''t space in segment zero to put a large real page table (the table that maps from real memory address to virtual).  Fixing this requires the ability to put the real page table somewhere else where there IS space; most of the associated work is in the Bcpl booting process.''Schlumberger is the main affected user.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 21-May-84 20':11':22Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Virtual MemoryMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
