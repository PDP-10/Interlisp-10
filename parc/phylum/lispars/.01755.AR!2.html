Consequently, when SPELLFILE eventually processes the list using a (for ... in ... ...), [rather than (for ... inside ... ...)] loop, the directory is ignored.  The most crucial case at the moment seems to be STARFONTDIRECTORIES, which can provide valuable information for the creation of DISPLAY and INTERPRESS fonts.  If the others aren''t used yet, they will be when the bugs are worked out of INTERPRESS.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  3-Aug-84 15':41':26Attn: Raim.pasaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: OtherMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
