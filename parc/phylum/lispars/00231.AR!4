Way back before we had control over typein from multiple processes worked out, we fixed it so that it would ask for the INIT file in the PROMPT window. However, once we got things worked out, it now asks for the password in the TYPESCRIPT window.''This inconsistency is annoying. It is more annoying because it happens frequently. I think the simplest thing to do is to take back out the use of PROMPTWINDOW here.''In general, we want to reconsider the current (overuse) of promptwindow; this is one instance with a fairly clear action.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84  9':49':45Attn: Assigned To: Masinter.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: '[Date': 13 Apr 84 09':08 PST'From': Masinter.pa'AR#231 (GREET file in typescript window) is FIXED]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
