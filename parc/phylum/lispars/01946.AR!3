'-------''Date': 25 Aug 84 21':02 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'To': Roach''There is a known bug wherein Lafite fails trying to send messages longer than 2^16 characters.  Is this your problem?  If not, can you characterize the failed messages in any interesting way?  And do I read you correctly that if it fails once, it fails always (but other messages send ok in the same environment)?'-------''Date': 26 Aug 84 10':42 PDT'From': Roach.pa''     These are all short messages.  If it doesn''t send to begin with, it doesn''t help to copy select the message into a new message window and send from there.  It doesn''t happen very often.  I tried PUTting the last such message to a file, but found out, after I had closed my window, that only the last sentence got stored.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 26-Aug-84 21':42':28
