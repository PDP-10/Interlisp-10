There are a couple places you seem'		   to use Xerox file servers directly.''		2) Try (DISPLAYSTATS ''(CONS ''A ''B)).'		   It breaks under a LOADFROM of NIL (yes NIL) from'		   {PHYLUM}<LISPCORE>SOURCES>PCALLSTATS.  Reverting to this'		   LOADFROM and RETURNing it proceeds ok until 3.''		3) It tries a LOAD? of {PHYLUM}<LISPUSERS>HISTOGRAM.DCOM and'		   GRAPHER.DCOM.  RETURNing from the LOAD? (after of course'		   loading those files by hand) it proceeds until 4.''		4) It gets to the point where it prints'			"------ Beginning evaluation of form"'		   right after that it breaks with ARG NOT ARRAY'		     {IOFILEINFOBLK}#n,nnnnn under GATHERSTATS.  At this point'		   I could not proceed.''	Let me know when a fixed version in on [MAXC]<XEOS>.  Thanks.'''						Jeff'Workaround: send PCALLSTATS to ShulmanTest Case: Edit-By: masinter.paEdit-Date: 19-Apr-84 11':57':55Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm': sent msg to Shulman re': availability of PCALLSTATS.
