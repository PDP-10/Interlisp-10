We plan to stage the "Fugue.6" release on [phylum]&lt;LispNew&gt; and, when approved, release to [phylum]&lt;Lisp&gt;.''I think it would be reasonable to avoid using [rose]&lt;Lisp&gt; except as a duplicate of [phylum]&lt;Lisp&gt;, and for you to stage your files on a different directory (&lt;1100Core&gt;?). ''Also, please note that not all Library packages listed below have been "blessed" for inclusion in the release, dubious items include EXEC, SETF, current SINGLEFILEINDEX (as opposed to old SINGLEFILEINDEX). ''Also, I think it is a mistake not to re-release the entire floppy set (perhaps automating the process of making them now that Interlisp-D floppy is in better shape.) I urge you to make a new consistent set, with distinctive labels, and to urge users to recycle old set. Otherwise, inconsistencies will plague our users and cause many spurious bug reports.'''If you automate floppy creation (by writing a program that does the appropriate FLOPPY.FORMAT and COPYFILEs for each floppy), then the floppy maker could also be staged, tested, and released.'     ----- Forwarded Messages -----''Date': Fri, 9 Mar 84 18':38 PST'From': Raim.pasa'Subject': Fugue.6 Release Kit'To': Burke, Dering,  JFung, Kiewiet, Le, Wogulis'cc': Martin, Masinter.PA, Raim''Here is the final cut of the Fugue.6 Release Kit.
