(but rigid space is wasted).''-----''Date': 27 Jun 84 14':08':16 PDT (Wednesday)'From': JFung.pasa'Subject': Re': Drive size from Prometheus script'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': JFung''Mike,''Looks like it is not likely to know the drive size, prior to partition.'Btw, Describe Physical Volume is also not available from the script, as I went thru the document.

One way to find out how many pages you have on your disk (and hence what sort of disk you have) is to get into othello, start creating a new physical volume with one partition, read the maximum number of pages it tells you you can put in that partition, and hit Delete before finishing the create.  Not at all graceful (there''s gotta be a better way), but it works.''--T'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 12-Jul-84 11':58':42Attn: JFung.pasaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ImpossibleFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
