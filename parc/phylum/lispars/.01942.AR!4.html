The current way loses if ADDTOFILE is called from some other program -- e.g. Denber.wbst''s CALENDAR package': the poor user has no idea what file is being referred to.  Callers of ADDTOFILE should not have to worry about whether to print  the filename themselves.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 27-Aug-84 20':58':16</pre>
