Apparently, my only gateway crashed and I could not talk to MAXC2 or ERIS.  "[MAXC2 not responding]" and 2 "No route to hosts" were printed in my PROMPTWINDOW while chatting to MAXC2 and trying to do a DIR & CONN on ERIS.  I went to a different machine and interracted normally with MAXC2 & ERIS.  When I came back to the Dandelion, I had'(1) In my promptwindow':'     Ran out of space running in process ''EXEC'(2) In my top level window':'     STORAGE FULL'     "save your work & reload a.s.a.p."'     (INTERRUPTED broken)'(3) In my maintenance panel'     9325'The Dandelion was only waiting for new input when I left it.  A Teleraid gave me the following stack':'     \MP.ERROR'     \CHECKFORSTORAGEFULL'     \ALLOCMDSPAGE'     \GCTYPE'     \GCMAPTABLE'     ALLOCATE.PUP'     \FILLBSPPUP'     \BSP.TIMERFN'     \RTP.SOCKET.PROCESS'     \EVALFORM'     ERRORSET'     \MAKE.PROCESS0'     T' Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 27-Aug-84 15':42':41
