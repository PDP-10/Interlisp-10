I think this may be dependent upon the file device (?do we want to change this?).  In any case I expected to find something like':''A file name is a sequence of any alphanumeric characters plus the characters {-, ~, @, \, /, etc.} (or whatever they are) containing at least one non-numeric character.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-May-84 16':36':16Attn: Kaplan.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
