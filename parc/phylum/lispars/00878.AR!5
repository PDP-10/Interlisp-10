The'problem appears to have to do with the large NS net number we'have.''   For pup world, our net numbers are':'         3MB - 45'        10MB - 48''   And our 10MB net is known in the NS world as net number 1853,'     a number given us by Xerox.''Cheers, Norton'-------'Date':  2 May 84 11':06 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#878': GATEWAY bug'To': 1100Support.pasa'cc': vanMelle.pa''Please find out what version of the gateway he is running.  If it''s the Nov 18 version that everyone else seems to have, it has a bug in the NS routing tables sent by the Gateway (possibly patched correctly, acccording to this message).  Is he starting the gateway with the correct setting of LOCALNETWORKLST?  What does PRINTROUTINGTABLE(NS) say for a machine on their 3mb net?  10mb net?''Particulars on this AR': I changed subsystem from NS Protocols to Lisp Servers, which is what the Gateway is, and removed Cooper from Attn.  In general, you should only attn Cooper on NS problems that are "high-level", Courier or above (specifically, talking to an NS file server, printer or clearinghouse).''	Bill'--------'1. We have a gateway.dcom from Fugue.4 with creationdate 18-Nov-83 09':59':25'  We also have a gateway.dcom from our Fugue.6 pre-release with creationdate'    18-Nov-83 19':59':25.  And we have a different gateway (I don''t know'    from where) with date 19-Mar-84 11':24':35.  This last does appear to'    work (almost - it periodically seems to require that the Dolphin'    re-check for a clearinghouse).
