Number: Date: 19-Aug-84 10':49':56Submitter: MasinterSource: MasinterSubject: want shift opcode in all UCodesAssigned To: Attn: Charnl,JonL,vanMStatus: OpenIn/By: Problem Type: PerformanceImpact: ModerateDifficulty: Frequency: Priority: HopefullySystem: Language SupportSubsystem: MicrocodeMachine: 1108Disk: Lisp Version: 15-Aug-84 20':06':06Source Files: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: Description: it seems clear that a lot of code would get simpler if there were a LSH opcode that took two args on the stack, and shifted one by the second. (A side effect of BIGNUMS is that LSH = LLSH and RSH = LRSH, and we thus only need *one* shift opcode).Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
