FLOPPY will print "Floppy': No floppy drive on this machine" before generating the system error "FILE WON''T OPEN".  Other operations, such as DIR {FLOPPY}* will continue to not generate an error, but instead make {FLOPPY} look like it has an empty directory so that file searches work correctly when {FLOPPY} is on the search path.]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion FloppyMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
