Jon L White'suggests I set system global HELPFLAG to BREAK!--a strategy I''ve tried before.'According to the IRM (p 9.11) "If HELPFLAG=BREAK!, a break will always occur'following an error."  If only it were true.  Doing'	(RPAQQ HELPFLAG BREAK%!)'doesn''t work as advertised.  I can get interaction like''	52_(FOOBAR X)''	UNDEFINED CAR OF FORM'	FOOBAR''	53_HELPFLAG'	BREAK!''without breaking.  I am therefore still stuck with the'(MOVD ''TRUE ''BREAKCHECK), must redefine SMARTARGLIST, and count on'the SINGLEFILEINDEX package to work properly.'     Impact _ Annoying'				Kelly'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Break PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
