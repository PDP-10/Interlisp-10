One defined FOO as a constant, and the other had a function FUM that had FOO has an argument.''FUM worked correctly interpreted, but not when compiled.  After wasting an hour trying to debug the situation, I discovered that even though FUM had a binding for FOO, that the compiled code had the constant value instead of the the value that was passed in.''The glitch (actually, it is really a bug, given how much energy and time it can waste) is that the compiler doesn''t print out a warning when it discovers this inconsistent use of the name FOO, the way it does when you attempt to bind a global or RESETVARS a non-global.''I think a check for this case should be executed whenever code for binding a variable is compiled.''--Ron''-----''Date':  6 Apr 84 17':51 PST'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': AR#277 Status_ Fixed'To': LispSupport'cc': Kaplan'''compiling now checks & warns if you attempt to bind a constant.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 18':03':18
