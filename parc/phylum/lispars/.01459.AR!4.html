Using Interlisp-D to COPYFILE a 2.5 mb sysout to or from'the 8037 took over an hour.  Copying that same sysout with the'installlisptool took only 1 minute and 14 seconds.  &uarr;T showed that'COPYFILE was using \SLOWCOPYBYTES.  Slow indeed!  This is in Fugue6.'I hope that the next release uses "reasonablecopybytes."'--Christopher'P.S.  We don''t have an 8037, so this isn''t really a complaint you have'to worry about.  I''m surprised your 8037 owners stand for it, though.'-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 18-Sep-84 21':38':09</pre>
