Occasionally the machine falls into RAID when fetching apage from disk to satisfy a page fault.  He puts the machine in TeleRaid, and the backtrace indicates the call to raid happens inside \DL.XFERDISK.  He assumes that he has hit a "bad spot" or the disk controller has misbehaved. After 6 or 7 stack frames are displayed by the machine running the TeleRaid user, the sick DTiger''s cursor inverts, and the DTiger goes silent over the TeleRaid connection, and the TeleRaid user soon breaks  (Remote system not responding).  At the point, no combination of ^D or STOP gets the sick DTiger out of Raid/TeleRaid.'' Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 24-Sep-84 18':04':26
