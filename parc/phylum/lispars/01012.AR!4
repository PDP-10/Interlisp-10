Then Prompt Window returns "Time not set", but DA returns the correct date and time.''------'Date':  9 May 84 10':48 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''Are you quite sure that the "[Time set to --]" was not left over from an earlier invocation of Lisp when it was on the ethernet?  The message "[Time reset to --]" is printed ONLY when the time is set from an ethernet time server, which you could not have had if you were not on an ethernet.''The message "[Time not set]", which you always get in a standalone configuration, means the time was not set from a time server, so Lisp is unsure whether the time is correct.  It uses the internally stored value, which happens to be correct if you have not powered down since correctly setting the time.  It would be nice if Lisp were smarter about that.''------'Date': 16 May 84 16':08 PDT'From': Kiewiet.pasa''After a week, I can''t swear that [Time set to] wasn''t "leftover", but what I was doing was testing the EI (Fixed Disk) Diagnostics floppy and setting the time. ''"Time not set" is annoying and seems a little silly when one has just set the time with BOTH the EI disk and the Installation Utility.  "Time not set by Ethernet" or "Time set by User from Utility to nn':nn':nn" would be more meaningful.''While installing Fugue6 at customer sites, the standalones still had the wrong time, even after setting it from EI and Installation Utility.  I DA''d after each installation and found that I had to (SETTIME).'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 22-May-84 15':53':00
