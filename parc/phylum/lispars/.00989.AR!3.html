It may be that various people are handling situations differently. (We''ve taken the view that ''Closed'' at this point means fixed in Fugue.6, right?)''-----''Date':  2 May 84 12':24':33 PDT (Wednesday)'From': Sannella.PA'Subject': How to handle ARs'To': LispCore&uarr;.pa'cc': 1100Support.pasa, LispSupport, Sannella''Recently, several people have asked me questions about how they should deal with their ARs.  The document {phylum}&lt;lispars&gt;LispARFields.press explains the meanings of the various fields to some extent, but not the procedures to use when CHANGING these fields.  Here are some guidelines':''When an AR is first submitted to the database, the "Attn':" field should be set to the name of the person responsible for the AR, so that this AR will appear on his AR summary.  In the case of urgent problems, the text of the message should be forwarded (via mail) to this person.  All new ARs should be submitted with Status = New, so that I can screen them for correct system/subsystem and attn fields.''When an AR has your name in the Attn field, it willl appear on your summary.  You should periodically review this summary for new ARs.  If an AR should be assigned to someone else, change the Attn field (sending a mail message to the new recipient, if it is an important problem).  You may also want to modify the Difficulty, Impact, etc fields.''If a new AR appears that is just a repeat of an old AR, you may want to combine them.  This is done by setting the status of one AR to Superseded, and adding "(superseded by AR xx)" to the Subject field.  Which of the two ARs should be superseded is up to you.  You may also want to copy text from the superseded AR to the "Main" AR.''As you work on an AR, you may send and recieve messages about it.  It is a good idea to append these messages to the "Description" field of the AR, so that there is a record of the correspondence.''If the AR description does not contain enough information for you to do anything, change the status to Incomplete, and correspond with the source of the AR to resolve the problem (adding the correspondence to the AR, of course).''If the problem does not seem to be a real problem, you may want to change its status to Declined.  Please send a message telling the source why the AR was declined.  Try to be polite --- just saying "your problem has been declined" can lead to charges of impersonal support staff, etc. ''Note': in some cases, the source of an AR may be an outside customer.  In this case, any correspondence on an AR (request for more info, etc) should go through 1100Support.pasa.''When an AR has been fixed, you can change the status to Fixed, and send a message to the source (if it is important fix).  You should also set the "Assigned to':" to your name, so that there is a record of who actually did the fix.  If you don''t want the fixed AR to show up on your summary, you may change "Attn" field to "Release".''Note': Marking an AR as Fixed does not mean that it has been released to anyone yet --- it just means that you believe that you have taken care of the problem.  The release master will use the text of the "Fixed" ARs to create the release message, and marked them "Closed" when the next release is released.''-----''Date':  2 May 84 13':02':43 PDT (Wednesday)'From': JFung.pasa'Subject': Re': How to handle ARs'In-reply-to': Sannella.PA''s message of 2 May 84 12':24':33 PDT (Wednesday)'To': Sannella.PA'cc': LispCore&uarr;.pa, 1100Support, LispSupport.PA''	"You should periodically review this summary for new ARs." '	'I assume once a week is a reasonable time to view the summary.  I saw you sometimes generated more frequent than that.  Can you explain to me the use/meaning of ActionItemSummary.press?

'	'	Just for your information, I believe we are using "Attn" &amp; "Assigned to" fields differently than the rest AR systems, but I have no objection to your rule.

That is what I thought':  ARs on ActionItemSummary HAVE TOP priority and should be taken care first.  I just want to stay on track with this.''I am aslo concerned and interested to learn how current PRIORITY are set.  For example, when people generated AR for my attention, who gets to set that priority.  Thu Le(local adminstrator), the source,  you floks at PARC?  What happen if source comes from outside customers?  And what role does the "attn" people play on this?

Informally, I consult with Marty and also Marketing for the amount of pain that is being caused by a particular problem. Eventually this should all get more formal than it is now.''It is less of a problem that it might seem b/c there is rarely any disagreement among a collection of Lisp programmers as to the priority of some feature. When there is, I consult with the people who are concenred and resolve it.''If you disagree with a priority setting of one of your bugs (or some else''s, for that matter), msg me and LispSupport requesting a priority change. Generally, it''s only worth doing this if it would make a major change to the schedule at which things get done. For minor bugs, it''s easier to fix them than to argue about them.''Beau''-----''Date':  7 May 84 17':45':05 PDT (Monday)'From': Masinter.PA'Subject': Re': How to handle ARs'In-reply-to': Sannella''s message of 2 May 84 12':24':33 PDT (Wednesday)'To': Sannella'cc': LispSupport''Michael,''Will you edit your remarks on How to handle ARs into the ''Implementors Guide''?
