This is true of Tops-20s as well as IFS, NS File servers, etc. There is in general no good way to search for the file before asking the user for the password': the "ask for password" prompt comes only after trying the null password and having it rejected.''(Status': Open -> Declined) ''["masinter" "24-Sep-84 18':27':31" Status':(Open->Declined) Disposition':]Description: While running InterLisp-D, if one needs a file from a file server, InterLisp-D always asks user to log in with a password before it searchs for the existence of the file.    This is  annoying ;especially ,when it returns with -file not found -in directory .  Is there any way that InterLisp-D should first look for file, and if file exists ,  then return asking user to log in?Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 24-Sep-84 18':27':32
