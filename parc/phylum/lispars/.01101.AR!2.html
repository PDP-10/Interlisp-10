The characters you type-in will often show up much later as mysterious type-ins in BREAK windows.  This can occur despite many intermittant type-ins to the Top level TTY window.  Frequency of this bizzare behavior is about 1 per day.  Only work around appears to be (RESETDEDIT).''Frank'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sheilEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 16':10':51</pre>
