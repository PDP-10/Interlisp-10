This is supposed to prevent the confusion that many novices have about what EVAL/EVALQT mode is doing to them.'''HOWEVER, there is a glitch, in that if the first thing on the line isn''t recognized and isn''t defined, it prints out the message and THEN complains, e.g., if you type''FOOBAZ 1 2 3 4 5''it will politely tell you''=(FOOBAZ 1 2 3 4 5)''and then complain''UNDEFINED FUNCTION'FOOBAZ'''probably should not bother ''correcting'' if it can''t really execute the form.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 27-Jul-84 15':56':48Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: DWIMMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
