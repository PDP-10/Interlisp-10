Particularly, I connot get accented characters.  What would it take to set the situation to rights?  It is really quite important for the translation work.'-Martin''-----''Date':  6 Jun 84 14':42 PDT'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1367': Want display font chars with width less than display width (like accents'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 6 Jun 84 12':57':22 PDT (Wednesday)'To': Kay.pa'cc': Kaplan, LispSupport.pa''It takes changing the font reading function to construct an array of display widths and changing \BLTCHAR to fetch it as will as the width to move. I would estimate 6 hrs.  I think the extension of font files like this is KS (for kerned-strike).  Is this what you had in mind using?''Richard''-----''From': kaplan.pa'Date':  6-Jun-84 16':25':00 PDT'Subject': Re': AR 1367': Want display font chars with width less than display width (like accents'In-reply-to': Burton''s message of 6 Jun 84 14':42 PDT'To': Burton'cc': Kay, Kaplan, LispSupport''I believe the NS character or rendering standard says something about accents.  If we were to implement that (eventually), would that be adequate?  (I.e., suggest that Martin get the relevant documents and let us know what he thinks.)''--Ron''-----''Date':  6 Jun 84 17':12 PDT'From': Kay.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1367': Want display font chars with width less than display width (like accents'In-reply-to': kaplan.pa''s message of 6-Jun-84 16':25':00 PDT'To': kaplan.pa'cc': Burton.pa, Kay.pa, LispSupport.pa''Can you point me to said relevant documents?''--Martin'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  8-Jun-84 10':23':24Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
