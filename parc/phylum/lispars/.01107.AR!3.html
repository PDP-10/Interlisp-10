Therefore, its habit of jamming a "?" on the end of the prompt field, constrains the sort of thing I can ask.  If  the user wants to have a "?" he can put on, but if he doesn''t want it, there isn''t any (easy) way to not put one.   Also, why is this the case, only with a list of promptstring items?  Are you expecting it to be used to simply select among a set of things?  I guess that''s reasonable but there should be a way to suppress the "?".  If there is, please let me know.''Thanks'	Jeff''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 12':52':17</pre>
