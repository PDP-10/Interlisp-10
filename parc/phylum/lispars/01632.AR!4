But that itsn''t quite what I wanted': Recall that the "main window" of one attached window may itself be attached to another window, etc. The code is a simple recursion which I wrote. I just think it needs to be in the ATTACHEDWINDOW package.''Austin''-----''Subject': AR 1532': way to access main window'To': AHenderson.pa'cc': lispsupport''I added the function MAINWINDOW(WINDOW RECURSEFLG).
