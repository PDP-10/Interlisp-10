Number: 732Date: 17-Apr-84 12':55':24Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Dietterich.paSubject: Shift-select of list into edit buffer shouldn''t "close" edit bufferLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 13 Apr 84 15':34 PST'From': Dietterich.pa'Subject': Lisp': Request for different/new feature in DEDIT'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Dietterich.pa'Lisp-System-Date':  9-Apr-84 18':28':19'Machine-Type': Dorado''I wish SHIFT selection in DEDIT would operate like FIX does in LISPX': namely, if you SHIFT-select an S-expression, then the expression is available for character editing.  This works presently for atoms, but not for other S-expressions.''--TOm''-----''Subject': Re': Lisp': Request for different/new feature in DEDIT'In-reply-to': Dietterich''s message of 13 Apr 84 15':34 PST'To': Dietterich'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''The problem is that shift-select just puts the edit characters into the edit buffer as if you had typed them, so when the closing paren is encountered, the expression is "closed".  Probably Dedit should notice when characters are shift-selected into the edit buffer, and not allow the expression to be closed in this situation.  I have added your request to our bug report database as AR 732 --- we will inform you when it gets addressed.''In the meantime, a hack I use is to type left-paren, shift-select the S-expr I want, and then delete the first left-paren.  Now, I can edit the expression with the character editor.  A terrible kludge, admittedly....'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Apr-84 13':06':14Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
