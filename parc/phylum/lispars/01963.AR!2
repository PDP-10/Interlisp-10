When you do this, and then type a space to get the computation to proceed, the newly exposed region comes up white instead of black.  Thus when the window is uninverted, that region gets turned to black, giving an ugly appearance until the black scrolls away.''Seems like the default reshapefn there (maybe TTYINs?) should know about the inverted status of the window and paint the newly exposed region black as well.''--Ron''-----''Date': 18 AUG 84 11':30 PDT'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': lets get rid of inverting windows'To':   Kaplan'cc':   LispSupport, Burton''Its always disruptive. How about just changing the *TITLE* of the window or something? There are a number of PAGEHOLD packages around, which have various degrees of hokum in them, but most are better than the current system behavior.''-----''Date': 20 Aug 84 18':30 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': lets get rid of inverting windows'In-reply-to': MASINTER.PA''s message of 18 AUG 84 11':30 PDT'To': MASINTER.PA'cc': Kaplan.PA, LispSupport.PA, Burton.PA,Bobrow.pa''Incidentally, Danny and I merged our "best ideas" from PAGEHOLD and PAGEFULLCTRL, and put them into PAGEHOLD; Loops, and Loops folks, are now using PAGEHOLD by default.
