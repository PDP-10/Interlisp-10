There exist some such tests on [eris]&lt;LispCore&gt;Test&gt; but they haven''t been verified or run on Interlisp-D versions in recent history. This would be an excellent job for 1100Support personnel to run on proposed new releases.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 11':02':47</pre>
