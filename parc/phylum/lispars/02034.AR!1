We would like you to use it in place of the current one before it is released to the un-friendly world.  Its stored as {ERIS}<LISPCORE>LIBRARY>GRAPHER.DCOM''It should help cure your array space problems.  The old Grapher created a bitmap per node.  This one doesn''t.  The price is that scrolling may take a little longer.  To REDISPLAYW a very large graph takes twice as long as it used to, but I think you will find it acceptable (if you don''t like this, set CACHE/NODE/LABEL/BITMAPS/FLG to T).  Also, the GRAPHRECORD was changed to burn half as many cons cells.  Fortunately, you do not have to recompile, since all the old fields that are advertised for public use were left in their old positions.''LAYOUTGRAPH takes a new format token.  Adding REVERSE/DAUGHTERS to the list of format items will reflect horizontal graphs vertically, and vertical graphs horizontally.''If you run in Harmony, then (HARDCOPYGRAPH <graph> <file> <imageType> <translation>) will produce a file from a formated graph (e.g., like SHOWGRAPH, only for files).  Currently, it only works for PRESS files.  Interpress files will be coming soon.  If the device field of the file name is LPT, the file will automatically get sent to the appropriate printer.  ImageType is, of course, either PRESS or INTERPRESS, and defaults to INTERPRESS.  Translation is a position in screen points of the lower left corner of the graph from the lower left corner of the piece of paper.  HARDCOPYGRAPH will go away when device-independent graphics comes.  People who want to print more than a single graph on a file can see the definition of HARDCOPYGRAPH. ''-- Ron & Kurt'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
