I can replicate the example.''--Ron''rrb':  A test case that screws up (DRAWCURVE ''((100 . 100) (-2200 . 0)(100 . -2200) T 1 NIL window).  It causes vertical lines to be drawn across the window.''The code inside \CURVE which does the calculations in done in rationals with 12 bits of integer part.  If the numbers in the knots get less than -2048 overflow occurs.  It would be a significant amount of work to redo it.  Hopefully  the boxing solution will allow us to use floating pt instead.  Status change to wait for floating pt.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 18-Jul-84 15':25':45Attn: BurtonAssigned To: burton, kaplanIn/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
