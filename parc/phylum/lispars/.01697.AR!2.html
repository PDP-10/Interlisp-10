Part of the time, I die with it trying to use one cond clause as the function to be applied to the rest of the clauses.  It seems that \EVALFORM is calling APPLY with COND and a list of the list of clauses as args.  HOWEVER, farther up the stack, there is another \EVALFORM that has called COND directly...?''BT'\EVALFORM, COND, APPLY, *ENV*, \EVALFORM, \EVPROGN, COND, \EVALFORM, \PROG0, PROG, \EVALFORM, \INTERPRETER1, \TEXTBIN, \BIN, \FORMATLINE, \TEDIT.FIXCHANGEDPART, . . .''[I traced the stack on hardcopy and gave it to LMM]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date: 15-Aug-84  1':02':08Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: [I looked at this but was confused by it, couldn''t get it to rehappen, etc. Am marking Incomplete.
