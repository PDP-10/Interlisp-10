At the time, I thought that it would only be important if the function OPENIPSTREAM was not smashed in the Carol Release.  As it turns out, it has never been on the smashatom list, so the following information is true in Carol, and should be given out to interested customers':''-----''Date': 15 Jun 84 10':21 PDT'From': Sannella.pa'Subject': Interpress info -- OPENIPSTREAM, bitmap patch'To': Raim.pasa'cc': Sannella.pa, Sheil.pa, Kaplan, Sybalsky''Because of the publishing of Interpress information, and because of some fixes to the Interpress code, I have some information that I think you should have down there, in case any customer asks.''(1)  Some customers want to generate their own Interpress streams.  Now that Interpress is no longer secret, we can give them this ability.  If any user asks, give them the following info':''(OPENIPSTREAM IPFILE REGION HEADING PREAMBLEFONTS)    [function]'	This function opens the file IPFILE, and creates an Interpress stream to that file.  The user can pass this stream to functions such as PRINT and DRAWLINE to print text and lines on the press stream.  After the stream is closed (with CLOSEF), it can be sent to an Interpress printer with NSPRINT.''	Warning':  currently, some display operations do not work on Interpress streams, like RELDRAWTO and DRAWCURVE.''	REGION is used to set the page margins within which printing will take place.''	HEADING is the heading to be used on each page.  If this is non-NIL, page numbers will also be printed.''	PREAMBLEFONTS is a list of fonts or font descriptors.  If this is not given, it is still possible to print on the Interpress stream, but this allows certain space and time efficiencies.''.....''''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 27-Jun-84 14':57':32Attn: KaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
