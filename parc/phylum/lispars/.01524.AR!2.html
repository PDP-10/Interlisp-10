The Lisp stack  was the following':''\MP.ERROR'\LISPERROR'\ILLEGAL.ARG'\PUTBASE.UFN'\MAKEFREEBLCK'\DECUSECOUNT'BLOCK'GETPUP'EXCHANGEPUPS'\PUP.SETTIME'\ETHEREVENTFN'\PUP.SETTIME'\ETHEREVENTFM'\DECIVEEVENT'MAKESYS'\EVALFORM'EVAL'\EVALFORM'\EVPROGN'COND'\EVALFORM'LISPX'ERRORSET'EVALQT'\REPEATEDLYEVALQT'\EVALFORNM'ERRORSET'\MAKE.PROCESS0'T''If I boot a standalone 1108 with full.sysout from 8-june-84 there is no problem.''We cannot release CAROL for beta testing until this problem is solved.''If you have some suggestions as to what we might try  in Teleraid, we will be happy to cooperate.''[bvm': problem does not happen on Dolphin.  Dolphin also appears to handle more cases of RETURN in uCode than Dandelion.  Likely problem is that either the Dandelion uCode handles some case wrong, or the ufn for that case is wrong.]'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 12-Jul-84 15':12':32</pre>
