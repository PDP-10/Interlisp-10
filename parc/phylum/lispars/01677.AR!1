When messages or prompts are written to windows like these, much more care should be taken to ensure that they''re readable.  Lafite regularly has the same problem.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 20-Jul-84 10':43':20Attn: sybalsky, nuyensAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: Status: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
