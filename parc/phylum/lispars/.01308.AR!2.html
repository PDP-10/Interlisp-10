An NLSETQ works as far as eliminating the break but it doesn''t'stop the message from being printed.'	Would it be possible for \LEAF.ERROR (and the equivalent'NS, DISK, FLOPPY and FTP error handlers) to see if they were under an'ERRORSET with a NIL second argument to decide whether to print their own'error messages or not?''							Jeff'-------''Date':  1 Jun 84 15':13 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 1308': Want to NLSETQ I/O errors so no message is printed'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 1 Jun 84 15':02':35 PDT (Friday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa''Hard, Unlikely.
