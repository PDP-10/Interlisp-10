I find it useful on a Dorado to do (LLBREAK ''\CREATE.TTYDISPLAYSTREAM), but this is not a very attractive user interface, and an even worse one on a Dandelion.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 11-May-84 16':39':59Attn: BurtonAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
