(hmmmm i guess control-j might work for that...'  must try it...) [well, i have  tried it... yes... control-j is a  way'  to type LF  on the  1108.  if  it is the  only way,  then the  manual'  should point that out.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  6-Apr-84 13':29':03Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: 1100Support.pasaIn/By: Disposition: [tl': copied Bill comments 4/2/84--This looks like an action item for 1100Support': the guide you give to users should definitely tell them what DLion keys correspond to what Dolphin keys.
