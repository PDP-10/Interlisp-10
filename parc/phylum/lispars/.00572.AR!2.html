The latter files did not show up in the browser, and instead what I saw was &lt;FOO&gt;FUM&gt;.;1 and &lt;FOO&gt;FUM.;2.  When I SEEd those files, what I saw was another browser window with the files in that directory, followed at the end by .;1 and .;2.  When I SEEed one of those, I got exactly the same kind of secondary browser, with the same funny files at the end.''Also, some of the FUM files were in a FIE subdirectory':  &lt;FOO&gt;FIE&gt;FUMZ.  These showed up in the browser as &lt;FIE&gt;FUMZ, which was very misleading.  If the common prefix &lt;FOO&gt; is going to be stripped off, then at least the filename in the browser should not begin with the dishonest open bracket.  If I don''t see &lt;FOO&gt;FIE&gt;FUMZ, at least I should see &gt;FIE&gt;FUMZ.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JellinekEdit-Date: 13-Sep-84 15':43':08</pre>
