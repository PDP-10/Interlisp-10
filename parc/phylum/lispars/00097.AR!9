It was my understanding that'Xerox was working on TCP/IP support, but now I hear that TCP/IP is'being done by a grad student at Berkeley in his spare time.  Can'anything be done to raise the priority of TCP/IP and get it done by'a real wizard in real time and supported?  Folks at Texas plan to buy'lots of Lisp machines (probably over $1 million this year), but it is'hard to convince them to buy machines that can''t talk to anything that'already exists.  MCC is potentially a large market too -- I hear they'have a contract for 40 Symbolics machines.'Thanks, Gordon'-------''----------------------------------------------------------------'----------------------------------------------------------------'Date': 18 Apr 84 13':58 PST'From': Cooper.pa'Subject': [Gregory G.
