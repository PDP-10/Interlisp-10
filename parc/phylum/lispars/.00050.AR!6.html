I suspect, though, that I''m not loading in ALL of the TEdit files.  IMAGEOBJ does get loaded, but I''m not sure about TFBRAVO.  Could you send me a list of all of the files?''While I''m at it,'I''ve run into an interesting problem.  I''m creating my own FMTSPEC.  Basically I''m playing around with the tab stops.  The tab spec I''m using is'(36 ((72 . RIGHT) (88 . LEFT))).  Well, the way this guy behaves is if you''re at the left margin, type a TAB, the right-hand justification works fine.  Type TAB again, and somehow it thought it was still to the left of 72, because that''s where the cursor ends up again.  This time, however, it''s doing it left-justified.  To get the behavior I want, I have to double-TAB to get the cursor to 88 after the right justified typing.  Any ideas?  Thanks.''--Ken.'-----'Date': 14 Mar 84 14':45 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Lisp': AR 50'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Sybalsky.pa'Lisp-System-Date': 13-Mar-84 10':21':31'Machine-Type': Dorado''Was fixed by moving the latest TEdit onto &lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt;.'''     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 18':58':39Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
