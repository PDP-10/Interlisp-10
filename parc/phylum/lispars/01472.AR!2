However, Interlisp lies to me (or at least misleads me) when it says "{CASK}<DMR>SHEM;103 => {LPT}"  It may be sent, but it never gets there.  Misleading msg, methinks.  Besides that, why does anyone call it {LPT}?  Talk about archaic holdovers.  Grump, grump.  (Or maybe it stands for "Laser Printer."  Right.)''----------------------------------------------------------------'Date': Tue, 5 Jun 84 09':13 EDT'From': dmrussell.pa'Subject': More on Printing'To': LispSupport'cc': dmrussell''Just to confuse things, I got the "Receiver timed out message", but still got my hardcopy.''-- DMR -- ''----------------------------------------------------------------''Date':  8 Jun 84 22':13 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': "receiver timed out" messages from Spruce printers'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 5 Jun 84 16':16':30 PDT (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle.pa''What''s the "old problem with file servers"?''He doesn''t say where he gets the "receiver timed out" messages from.  Might be related to the problem he described talking to Wabash servers, on which I interacted with him some (final answer not yet known).  In the course of that I did observe that there definitely IS a bug or misfeature in the Empress code such that if the printing host sends back an "ExternalReceiverAbort", Empress prints the error message accompanying the abort and simply returns NIL.  This leads the guy who copied file to {LPT} to lie about its success.  ExternalReceiverAbort conventionally means there is something wrong with what you''re trying to send such that trying again later won''t help.  I''ve never seen it around here in real life.  A break rather than quietly returning NIL seems to be a more appropriate response.''	Bill''-----''Sender': Sannella.PA'Date': 11 Jun 84 14':54':39 PDT (Monday)'Subject': Re': "receiver timed out" messages from Spruce printers'In-reply-to': vanMelle''s message of 8 Jun 84 22':13 PDT'To': vanMelle'cc': LispSupport'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''What I meant by "the old problem with file servers" was AR 721 (Writing to NS file server gives many "Filesever':filing#nn not responding" msgs).
