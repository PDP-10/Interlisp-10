I selected "Just" in the paragraph looks menu, and broke with an ILLEGAL ARG NIL in (TEXTOBJ NIL) in TEDIT.FIND.OBJECT in MB.NWAYBUTTON.SELFN.  The TEXTOBJ local in the latter two frames was NIL.  If I ^ out of the break, "Just" is highlighted, the formerly highlighted "Left" has but a bar over it, and subsequent selections in the menu succeed.''Furthermore, while I''m in that break, I can''t type to any other tedit window.   I had to ^ out before I could type this message.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':26':13Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: OnceImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
