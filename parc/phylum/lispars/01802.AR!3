It is a reasonable to expect them to work. For example, various teratives don''t work':''(for I from 1 to 4 always (FOO I))''doesn''t work because "always" has a (BIND ($$VAL _ T)) which doesn''t translate properly when CLISPFLG is NIL, presumably because of the "_".''The BIND notation in iteratives is unfortunate, but I think we are stuck with it. It is probably reasonable to special case making it work even with "_" is disabled, either specially or because CLISPFLG is NIL.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':11':23
