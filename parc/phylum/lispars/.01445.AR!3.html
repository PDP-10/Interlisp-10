Number: 1445Date: 14-Jun-84 16':57':21Submitter: AcuffSource: AcuffSubject: Error while uninterruptable causes MP 9318Lisp Version: 10-Jun-84 18':41':09Description: The following code causes a DLion to hang with 9318 in the MP':  (RESETLST (RESETSAVE (INTERRUPTABLE NIL)) (RESETSAVE (SUSPEND.PROCESS ''MOUSE) (WAKE.PROCESS ''MOUSE))).  Note that this code is erroneous (the second arg to the second RESETSAVE should be quoted), but crashing seems to be a bit severe of a punishment.''-------'Date': 21 Jun 84 11':11 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''I changed the subject to "Error while uninterruptable causes MP 9318" and declined it.  It''s a feature, sort of.  Basically, if you''re going to be so radical as to turn interrupts off, and then cause an error, you should not expect Lisp to treat it normally -- you said you wanted to be uninterruptable, yet at the same time you want to be able to service a normal break!''In your particular case, had you continued the 9318 with a &uarr;N, you''d have seen your error was ATTEMPT TO SET NIL OR T because of your incorrect RESETSAVE.  But any kind of error while uninterruptable would have given you the 9318.''-----''Date': 21 Jun 84 11':39 PDT'From': Acuff.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1445': (WAKE.PROCESS ''MOUSE) in RESETLST causes MP 9318'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 21 Jun 84 11':11 PDT'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': Acuff.pa, LispSupport.pa''   The behavior is reasonable, but undocumented.  How about adding something about this under the RESETLST documentation (though I might be the only one around silly enough to make such a stupid mistake)?''	-- Rich''Workaround: Code correctly.Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Jun-84 12':40':26Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: [bvm 6/21/84 feature, not bug]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: 1108Disk: Q2040 (43MB)Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 8191File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: HopefullyStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
