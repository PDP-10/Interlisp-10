But the TEdit Menu window could not be closed -- fell into a break  underneath DOUSERFNS, TEXTMENU.CLOSEFN, TEXTOBJ, \ILLEGAL.ARG.  Apparently it was gettting a pointer to a previously closed window, and not liking it.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 20-Jun-84 15':38':29Attn: Assigned To: SybalskyIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
