I''m not sure if I can reproduce the problem, but I would like to know what is happening when it arises and how to get around it.''Occasionally something on the local {DSK} will get messed up as a result of trying to delete a file.  Upon trying to OPENFILE on a {DSK} file, I''ll get the break window with the message "SHOULDNT - keyNotFound."  This seems to be a very informative message for someone who knows what a "Key" is.  I don''t.  Can one salvage the file on the {DSK} after this situation occurs?  What does that message mean?  What caused it?''--Ken.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':24':39Attn: Assigned To: StansburyIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
