One case that it misses occurs when you give a multiple command sequence (using the CONTROL key) such as () Delete Exit.  Since EXIT is the last command, Dedit exits without updating the display.  Now, it COULD update the display before exiting, but an alternative (probably what the user intended) is to simply shade out the window as it exits.''I''ve used this sequence often and frequently I''ve been confused by the contents of the lingering Dedit window.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
