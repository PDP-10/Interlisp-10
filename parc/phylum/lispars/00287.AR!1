There is nothing that ensures that the file so fetched is the right version.  A common need is "I want a version of FOO at least as recent as when some particular feature I depend on was added".  For example, I would like LAFITE to be able to say''(FILES (NEWERTHAN "21-Mar-84 12':21") GRAPEVINE MAILCLIENT)''This would tell FILESLOAD either (a) if the indicated file(s) are not yet loaded, then be sure that whatever file you do find to load has a recent enough date, and (b) if the file(s) are already loaded, but the filedate (as stored on the FILEDATES prop) is too old, then generate an error (or possibly ask for permission to load a newer version if one is found).''This doesn''t cover the case where you''re developing two parallel incompatible versions, and doesn''t get into the complexity (and major hassle) of assuring that you have exactly the right version (e.g., too new a version in which the records of changed), but it at least handles a simple case and doesn''t seem too hard.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Kaplan.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: WishProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
