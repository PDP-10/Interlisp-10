Number: 1667Date: 18-Jul-84 16':40':28Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Shrager.paSubject: Want way to make sure that windows do not go off the screenLisp Version: Description: 'mjs -- of course, wizards can always retrieve off-screen windows by hacking the value of ACTIVEWINDOWS, but this is a bit complicated for most users.  Perhaps there could be a simple function (DRAGWINDOWS) which makes sure that all windows are on the screen.  Perhaps this should be an item in the background menu.''-----''Date': 18 Jul 84 04':36 PDT'From': Shrager.pa'Subject': Anno Bug (?)'To': Burton'cc': Poduska.PASA, LispSupport''Richard,''	Patty Poduska ran into a rather obscure AnnoLand problem this morning. The submenu selection that shows a graph of the Annos only does so if the old anno graph window is closed (or, maybe if it changes).  Also, the graph can get displayed off of the screen, if, for example, you had an extended menu up again the top of the screen and did AnnoGraph.  Since the Annograph isn''t attached to the tedit window (is this a bug?) if you get yourself into a state so that that window is off of the screen, you''ve lost it for good (unless you do some wizardly window hacking to find it again).''	Perhaps what should happen is that the annograph should show someplace else if it''s going to end up off the screen.  Otherwise, maybe it should be attached to the tedit window so that it can all be moved.''	Actually, I''m think that there should be a function that makes sure that all open windows are at least a little bit on the screen.
