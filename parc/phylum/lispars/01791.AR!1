A hack got put in to call PROMPTFORWORD in Interlisp-D instead of ASKUSER. Did anybody actually find out why ASKUSER was broken and fix it?''(I''ve stumbled across the hack which didn''t work in the non-Interlisp-D case when trying to load up Interlisp-10. I''d like to just remove it.)''-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
