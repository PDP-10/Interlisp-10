The situation was this':  I needed to augment'the record package to include something of the form':''(make <newitem> memberof <path> of <object>)''which would translate to':''(OR (MEMBER <newitem> (fetch <path> of <object>))'    (replace <path> of <object> with '     (CONS <newitem> (fetch <path> of <object>))))''So I then wrote a "tran" function and placed this function on the'CLISPWORD property of MAKE, make, MEMBEROF and memberof.  "OF" and'"of" already had RECORDTRAN on the CLISPWORD property so I left it'(the doc on CLISPWORD (p 16.22) did not say it could be a list.)''Now, when a function containing my "make" form was prettyprinted both'the words "make" and "memberof" were boldface (the CLISPFONT) but the'word "of" was in plain text.  To make a long story short, it turns out'that in order for prettyprint to print CLISPWORDs in the CLISPFONT each'word must have the same "tran" function on the CLISPWORD property.''I don''t know whether to call this a bug or a "feature."''							Jeff''P.S. I solved my problem by making "make" and "memberof" both'RECORDTRAN CLISPWORDs (like "of") and ADVISING RECORDTRAN to use'my "tran" if it sees the "make" keyword.'-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 19-Mar-84 12':11':21Attn: Kaplan.PAAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm minor edit]System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: PRETTY
