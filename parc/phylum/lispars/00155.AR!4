As far as I can'tell, Fugue6 and the Beta release Carol work identically, though the'Tedit supplied with Fugue and that supplied with Carol do not.''Using the old (Fugue) Tedit, Press printing works ok, but Interpress does'not.  With the new (Carol) Tedit, neither works, and Interpress looks even'worse than with the old (but I''ll send a separate message about that).''Here is what I think is happening for Interpress (doing a Hardcopy in Tedit'of attachedwindow.tedit)': for each font needed, it first looks for a .WD'file in the directories specified by STARFONTDIRECTORIES, which it doesn''t'find.  It then looks at the first file on FONTWIDTHSFILES.  If that is'NSFonts.Widths, it then looks at the second file (which was Fonts.Widths).'If the first file is Fonts.Widths it never looks at the second file.  It'then prints a file with a ragged right edge (should have been justified) and'lots of overstriking.  It looks very much like all the spacing calculations'were done with the Press font widths, though the actual printing was of'course done with Interpress fonts.  It does not appear to ever use the'variables NSFONTWIDTHSDIRECTORIES or NSFONTDIRECTORIES.''Also, if I do (FONTSET ''STANDARD) (using an unmodified FONTDEFS), it breaks'with FONT NOT FOUND (MODERN 6 ...) in FONTCREATE under'INTERPRESSFONTPROFILE, after looking at both Fonts.Widths and NSFonts.Widths'(even if Fonts.Widths was first), after failing to find the .WD file from'STARFONTDIRECTORIES.''So, it appears that (1) it never finds what it is looking for in'NSFonts.Widths, and (2) if it happens to look in Fonts.Widths first and'finds the desired font, it is happy with that even if it should have been'looking for Interpress widths.''Tom'-------''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84  9':28':57Attn: Assigned To: SybalskyIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: '[Date':  2 Apr 84 11':38 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Lisp': AR 155 (doc NS directories stuff)'To': LispSupport.pa''is fixed.]'["Sannella.PA" "15-Aug-84 13':09':45" Description':]System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: FontsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: ClosedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
