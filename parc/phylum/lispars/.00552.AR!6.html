I started Lafite, but then realized that I wanted to be logged in as Maia Pindar. This realization came when Lafite was asking for confirmation to create files in {Phylum}&lt;AHenderson&gt;Lisp&gt;. I didn''t confirm, but then could not figure out how to redirect Lafite. I logged in as Maia, and connecte to her directory, turned Lafite OFF and ON again, and still it insisted on being AHenderson. Note however that this form was created with her name on it. Help with either a model or a command or a change in the behavior.''Thanks,''Austin''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 13':15 PST'From': ckiparsky.pa'Subject': Lafite': UNSUCCESSFUL     LOGIN 'To': LafiteSupport.pa'cc': ckiparsky.pa'Lafite-System-Date': 28-Feb-84 13':10':33'Lisp-System-Date': 20-Mar-84 18':25':18'Machine-Type': Dandelion''I have logged in at the top level and in the Lafite TTY, but I cannot get my active mailfolder - the previous user''s comes up, though I get my own forms for sending mail, and my name in the Lafite Status Window.''Please help.''Carol Kiparsky''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 13':57 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': UNSUCCESSFUL     LOGIN 'In-reply-to': ckiparsky.pa''s message of 9 Apr 84 13':15 PST'To': ckiparsky.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa''Lafite''s default location to look for mail files is specified by the variable LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&amp;DIR, or if that is NIL, then your "home" directory, the value of LOGINHOST/DIR.  Neither of those variables is affected by LOGIN.  You probably want to both LOGIN and then call GREET to load your init file, which is the best place to have those variables defined.''	Bill''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 15':03 PST'From': ckiparsky.pa'Subject': Lafite': in-reply-to': vanMelle''s message, 15 minutes ago'To': LafiteSupport.pa  'cc': ckiparsky.pa'Lafite-System-Date': 28-Feb-84 13':10':33'Lisp-System-Date': 20-Mar-84 18':25':18'Machine-Type': Dandelion''Thanks for your reply.  Doing LOGIN and GREET for the second time today did not affect the situation.  LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&amp;DIR gave me "{phylum}&lt;ckiparsky&gt;mail&gt;".   When I tried to plug this into LAFITE ''ON it gave me "unbound atom   ckiparsky "!  And "browse" still just brings up Ishikawa''s folder.

Various possibilities':''(1) There is a browser open on a folder that needs updating but which you don''t have write access to.  Solution': Before quitting, close the browser, selecting "Don''t Update".''(2) The Lafite is "greeted" for someone else and it is trying to update that user''s profile.  I.e., LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&amp;DIR and/or LOGINHOST/DIR were set for someone else.  Solution':  retfrom the function that is updating the profile (something like \LAFITE.WRITE.PROFILE).  Not so nice, but Lafite is currently not very good at changing users midstream.''	Bill''------'Date': 30 Apr 84 09':43 PDT'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Lafite': Can''t clear LafiteUser''Lafite System Date':  8-Apr-84 17':20':45'Lisp System Date': 26-Apr-84 11':50':17''Found that someone else had started Lafite in an image I wanted to run in.

The only thing remaining to do before turning Lafite back on is to tell it where you keep your mail files by setting LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&amp;DIR, or if that is NIL and you like to keep it NIL, LOGINHOST/DIR.  These variables are a typical part of people''s profiles, so many take care of this by calling (GREET).''It would be nicer if Lafite did this automatically when it notices a different user logged in, but I haven''t yet devised a smooth way to do it (there''s no way, for example, for Lafite to know where your file server is, for example, or that you really want your mail on {DSK4} instead of {Ivy}&lt;Stefik&gt;Mail&gt;).''	Bill''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  6-Aug-84 16':15':42Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
