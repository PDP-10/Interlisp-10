Sorting the mail once it is stored away in the file is a bit tougher, since it requires the ability to parse the relevant date in the header and dates sometimes come in odd forms (and this also raises the question of whether it is the Date field you want to sort on; consider delayed arpanet mail--you might want to sort on the date appearing in the most recent Received-From field).''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date:  8-Jun-84 21':45':36</pre>
