It''s not clear that it''s important to do so, either.  What good does it do you to know that DSK1 exists if you can''t use it?''Workaround, of course, is to ^E out of the prompt, just like with most other password prompts.']''-----''Date': 23 Apr 84 18':43 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': AR 810': (HOSTNAMEP ''{DSK1}) shouldn''t Log in to DSK1'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 23 Apr 84 17':18 PST'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa, JonL.pa''I discovered this bug from a functional interface to HOSTNAMEP, and the fact the it didn''t return (i.e., got hung up in the PROMPTFORWORD) was only noticed hours later.  Typing ^E would only work for interactive sessions.''The situation stems from wanting to determine the state of a Dorado --   existence of DSK1, DSK2, ... or DSK5 means you don''t have a CEDAR Dorado.  It''s reasonable to ask if DSK19 exists, and if DSK1 exists, even though one wouldn''t be using them, since that indicates whether or not the Dorado has a large disk, and whether or not Cedar is present.''''Workaround: ^E out of the promptTest Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 24-Apr-84 15':28':00Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Dolphin/Dorado DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files:
