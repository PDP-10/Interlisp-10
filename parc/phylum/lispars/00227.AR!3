Flg has to be T, not any old non-nil value.  Other non-NIL values are assumed to be action args to KEYACTION.  The idea is that if someone has set Blank-bottom to some random behavior, then (RESETFORM (METASHIFT T) --) will correctly restore that random behavior.  Not terribly pretty, I admit.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 18':47':41
