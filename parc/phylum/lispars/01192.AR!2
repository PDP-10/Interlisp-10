In this situation I can''t get into'TELERAID with CTR-SHIFT-DEL either.  The machine doesn''t react to any'type in and interrupts have no effect.  When I'try to boot Tajo I hang with an MP code of 915.''I now recall that this has  happened  to me  3  times in the last 1 1/2'weeks.  This is why I bring it to your attention.  I have also noticed'that the Dlion in Levy''s office was hung in 915 for several days'last week.  I seem to remember that preceding all these incidents I had'a problem not being able to boot Tajo and ending up with a 915 due to'my having installed moonboot from <mease>10.0>basics,'but I don''t have wrong diagnostic microcode on the machine now, at least'I havent explicitly put it there (I did try a 5 boot, which failed, but'I wouldn''t expect that to have lasting bad'consequences).''On previous occasions I have reformatted my disk when this situation occurred'(i.e. not being able to boot Tajo), after'an ill-afted attempt at rebooting lisp after logout.  That'usually puts me bacck in business, but it didn''t do the trick on Levy''s'machine.''Hope this info helps, or at least that you are'the right people to send it to.''		Kris' ''Postscript':  Even though my machine did get hung in 915''s inspate of several 1 boots on the eve of the 15th, it booted ok into tajo on the morning of the 17th.  Self-repair? (I noticed that the clearing house wasn''t operating on the evening of the 15th,  could that be relevant?
