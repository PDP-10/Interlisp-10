That is, could he read/write {DSK1} from {DSK2}?''I have marked this Hard, Unlikely.  Our experience around here has been that some Dolphins have difficulty accessing the other partition from within Lisp, and it is most likely because of some marginal problem in the disk controller--Lisp stresses the disk slightly harder than does the Alto OS and hence the standard diagnostics.  Depending on how good the disk is, everything may be fine, or you''ll get hard disk errors trying to access your own partition, or you''ll have trouble reading the other partition.  I strongly doubt we''ll be able to do anything about this in Lisp.  Are there any 1100 hardware experts to investigate this?''AR#750 re Dorado disk may or may not be in the same situation, as described in an earlier message.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 28-May-84 16':50':02</pre>
