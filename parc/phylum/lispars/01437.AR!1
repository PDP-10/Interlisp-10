Menus'select the form and depth of the graph.  Another menu selects a filter'or set of filters to prune the graph.  Buttoning a node allows a user'to inspect (1) the argument list of a function, (2) the type of a'function, (3) the ccode for a function, or (4) the localvars,'freevars, and globalvars of a function.  Additionally, one can break'the function, trace it, edit it, do a WHEREIS on it, BKSYSBUF it'into the typing stream, or graph it to a still deeper level.'	GRAPHCALLS uses the linker information returned by CALLS'rather than a masterscope database, so it is much faster than the latter.'	GRAPHCALLS is filed in [SUMEX] or [CSLI] '<LISPUSERS.FUGUE6>GRCALLS.DCOM, MSS, IMP, & PRESS.  There is a Fugue 4'GRCALLS.DCOM in <LISPUSERS.FUGUE4>GRCALLS.DCOM.  Questions about'distribution should be addressed to me rather than to Christopher.'--Christopher'-------'     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: FixedProblem Type: Source Files:
