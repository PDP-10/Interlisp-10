Two points for pointing out DEFPRINT to me; But how come that isn''t a file command?  Maybe the more general solution to this is to have a special (like in ZetaLisp) arg in DATATYPE (or RECORD or whatever) that specifies the type''s DEFPRINT and this should be put on thje props of the type, stored with the type, and loaded with the type.  This is the matter I was trying to resolve in the first place.''--Cheers,'	Jeff (Working off embarassement by turning suggestions into bug reports.)''-----''Date': 28 Jun 84 14':22 PDT'From': Shrager.pa'Subject': Lisp': AR1514 DEFPRINT'To': LispSupport.pa''Lisp System Date': 19-Jun-84 14':48':49'Machine': Dorado (Shrager)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': n/a'Impact': n/a''The best solution, suggested be Ron Kaplan, seems to be to include the DEFPRINT in the record''s INIT field.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: KaplanEdit-Date: 15-Sep-84 03':06':17</pre>
