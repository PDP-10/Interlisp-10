Wouldn''t it make for smoother operation to combine INTPATCH and SAVEVMPATCH as I did with FUGUE6PATCH and basically just have one patch file called, say, {Eris}<Lisp>ReleaseName>PATCHES  and .DCOM  ?''-- JonL --''-----''Date': 16 Jul 84 15':27 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': Re': INTPATCH for running SPY in Fugue.6'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 16 Jul 84 15':19 PDT'To': JonL.pa'cc': LispSupport, 1100Support.pasa''I think we get enough incremental orthogonal patches that separating them out makes sense, at least for Xerox internal users.

It might make sense to send out a single file which they generate by merging all of the other files together, or maybe just a single ''patches'' floppy....''-----''Date': 16 Jul 84 17':50 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': INTPATCH for running SPY in Fugue.6'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 16 Jul 84 15':27 PDT'To': Masinter.pa'cc': JonL.pa, LispSupport.pa, 1100Support.pasa''Well, why not just periodically append all the incremental patch files into a composite file, so that even internal users need load only one file of patchs.''-- JonL --''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sannella, RaimAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Release ProcedureMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
