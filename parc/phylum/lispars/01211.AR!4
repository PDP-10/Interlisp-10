There is some arcane and obsolete code in DWIM which attempts to detect when you type in ''edit'' commands at the executive when you meant to be in the editor. It was dubious when the TTY editor was the only editor in town, but just downright wrong for DEDIT.''I suspect that removing this growth will reqire a bit of delicate surgery. I would be happy to see an AR on the subject, Attn': Masinter, Priority': Hopefully.''-----''Date': 19 MAY 84 22':47 PDT'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': minor surgery performed...'To':   JonL, LispSupport''I made two changes to DWIM':''a) typing TTY editor commands to the top level will *NOT* send you into the editor. I think few users will miss this. DWIM is of necessity ''heuristic'', attempting to second guess what the user meant. However, this is one that, over time, has become wrong far mor often than right. Its one of the problems of DWIM that it has to grow and change as the rest of the system changes in order to do a good job of guessingwhat the user means.''...''Now': I think I''ve completed the surgery, but I haven''t sewn the patient back together yet': I''m working on Maxc and have tested the new DWIM and macro expansion interpreted, but I have not compiled the new versions. They are DWIMIFY and MACROS on <LispCore>Sources>. ''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':06':53
