The Inspector''s Set command should probably perform (CLEARBUF T) as soon as possible after making itself the tty process, with the hope of getting rid of old typeahead, without getting in the way of the user quickly typing in the set value.''[Problem is that "as soon as possible" has to be after the prompt window is created, or else the CLEARBUF creates a tty window in order to (GETSTREAM T ''INPUT).  Possibly CLEARBUF should special case that, since CLEARBUF is called almost exclusively on T.]''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 29-Jun-84 16':09':54</pre>
