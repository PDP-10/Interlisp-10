ITS).  Scrooling makes me seasick, and anyway, means I can''''t read the screen while it''''s printing out.  This would be especially useful in CHAT and the EXEC window.''''-----''Date': 20 Jun 84 14':10 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Wrapping windows'In-reply-to': Sannella.PA''s message of 19 Jun 84 14':44':06 PDT (Tuesday)'To': Sannella.PA'cc': Jonl.PA, Wallace.PA''It doens''t work on the regular windows (I only fixed it for RS232CHAT).  The patch to LLDISPLAY and WINDOW to make it usable isn''t quite what Richard recently put in, and I just haven''t had time to follow it up right now.''I need a reminder to do the follow-up, in about two weeks after the RS232C stuff for the DLion is complete.
