I would like to think of these as a  set of folders in a file drawer in which exactly one "file folder" is "pulled out" at any moment.  The behavior I want is that when I button one window, I want the current TOP window to "go back to where it was" in the obscuring stack.  In other words, I want to impose an order on the windows such that, unless a window is topmost, it is always in the same relative obscuring position.  I can simulate this behavior by bringing all the windows above it TOTOP in the proper order, but this is slow and inefficient.  An efficient solution would seem to require help from the window system.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
