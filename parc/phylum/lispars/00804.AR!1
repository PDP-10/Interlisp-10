I believe the most recent incident occured while ?= was page-swapping/thrasing on some name that wasn''t a defined function.  It apparently flashs the screen at you once to indicate that no arglist information was found, and I happened to hit ^D just about the window-invert time.''The code for FLASHWINDOW and RINGBELLS is suitably interrupt protected (hence isn''t the culprit) -- so who does  ?= use to do the inversion?''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
