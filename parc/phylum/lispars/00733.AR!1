It would be nice if this got passed down somehow--either by setting up the window''s ICON property before calling DOUSERFNS or by passing down some kind of second arg to SHRINKFNs.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
