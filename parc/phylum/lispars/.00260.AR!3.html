Something that TEDIT has on its stack when a GC gets invoked causes the DLion GC to get a 9305. Probably it is trying to reference count on the stack something that isn''t a valid pointer. I guess this is a DLion microcode problem, but it is pretty serious. Could be fixed by either fixing DLion microcode or TEdit, I would guess.''Intermittent, Serious, Attn': Charnley, Sybalsky, Hopefully, Difficulty': Moderate'''Second bug': ''in sending the first bug report, I got an ILLEGAL ARG - NIL under GV.ADDTOITEM. I think the problem was the COPYBYTES from the TextStream to the BSP stream got a NIL as the value of BIN from the textstream. This could be an artifact of the previous report where I had a problem because it crashed in the middle of a GC.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 15-May-84 16':56':23</pre>
