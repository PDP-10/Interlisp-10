Seems to happen most consistently if I click in an area of white space not in the vicinity of a menu selection item.  In fact, if I hold the button down, I get these errors piling up on each other.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':29':07Attn: Assigned To: SybalskyIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
