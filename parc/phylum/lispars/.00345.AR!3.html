What Interlisp-D really needs is a graphics package with at least Siggraph 2D core capabilities.  Meaning': support for windows (not our kind, the traditional graphics kind), viewports, clipping, etc.  Having something like that would have greatly simplified the package I''m writing now, and would have made it easier to augment.''It''s too late for me to back out of what I''ve written so far, unfortunately;  I just want to add this idea to the wish list.''		Herb'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 26-Apr-84 13':09':32Attn: Jellinek.paAssigned To: Jellinek.paIn/By: Disposition: I have written such a beast (TwoD.dcom) - to be released soon.System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: LibraryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: UnlikelyStatus: FixedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
