When you'button that it gives you INITCOMS in an edit window then IMMEDIATELY 'returns to top level with T.  If you type (DV INITCOMS) without the'quote it works.  You get the same behavior using EDITV instead of DV.''	I should mention that DF (and EDITF) work correctly with the'function name quoted or unquoted.''	Needless to say these bugs were confusing to the new user'(but I guess that is what you pay me to straighten out.)''							Jeff'-------'Date': 10 Apr 84 16':00 PST'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': AR 593': NLAMBDA entries to editors confused if given QUOTEd arg'In-reply-to': your message of 10 Apr 84 11':19':47 PST (Tuesday)'To': SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA'cc': LispSupport.pa, masinter, burton''You have several bugs and misunderstandings rolled together here.''a) (DC ''INIT.LISP) reports that "(QUOTE INIT.LISP) is not a loaded file" NOT "INIT.LISP is not a loaded file" as you report. That error msg is completely clear and correct, altho one might argue that DC should look for this and do the EVAL. I don''t think so.''b) (DC INIT.LISP) is the correct expression. It fails in this instance because INIT.LISP is usually NOT a loaded file but a masquerade for some other file (e.g. INIT.NONET or INIT.RUTGERS etc). (Look on FILELST for the real name by which the file package knows it)''c) EDITCOMS is documented on page 17.50 (3rd line from top) where it is described as an internal edit fn that interprets commands underneath an already running edit. It is not what you want. (I think that this description and the index entry for it should be removed from the manual.)''d) (DV ''INITCOMS) fails because EDITV does not have all the special case cruft that EDITF does - in particular, it does not eval list args. [The discrepancy is a non-feature and should be corrected.]  EDITV then calls EDITE on ''INITCOMS, which is a non-list and is therefore INSPECTed, which spawns a new process (hence the "then IMMEDIATELY returns to top level with T")''Beau'Date': 10 Apr 84 16':06 PST'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Re': AR 593': NLAMBDA entries to editors confused if given QUOTEd arg'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 10 Apr 84 11':19':47 PST (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa''Rephrase': EDITV and EDITF entries should be consistent - currently one evaluates (EDITF) the other doesnt.''Both should use standard file package entries rather than ad  hoc code.''Priority': Perhaps; Imapct': Annoying.
