Either'/CNDIR and other such should not coerce to all upper case (probably the'wrong solution) or the upper case standard should be adhered to uniformly.'ht'-----------------------'Quite easy, actually -- just changed the function which maps logical volume numbers onto volume names to U-CASEify its result before returning it.  -- Tayloe Stansbury'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':25':51Attn: Assigned To: stansburyIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: [hts 5-7-84': changed Assigned To (from no one), Attn (deleted Kaplan), Status (from Open), Difficulty (from Moderate).]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
