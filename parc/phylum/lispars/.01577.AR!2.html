But that message remains even after you select a file.  Suggestion':  Keep track of whether that message has been printed in the prompt window, and then when the user finally makes a selection and you know that that message is up there, then clear the promptwindow.''Second, the various switches for different kinds of information seem to be no-ops.  When I turn on (by bugging them with left or middle) Length, Pages, etc. and hit Info, I always see the same three things (Size, Created, Last Written).  ''Third, since Size, Created, and LastWritten seem to be the defaults when the thing comes up, they should initially be grayed out to indicate that they are selected.''Fourth, I''d like to see Author in the list of attributes.''RonWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JellinekEdit-Date: 13-Sep-84 14':27':15</pre>
