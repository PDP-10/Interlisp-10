Can anyone send any words of wisdom regarding any of the 'following?' ...' 4. A couple of questions about the RS232CHAT facility': first, what''s the 'story on MAKEBINHOOK?  My documentation says it wasn''t "quite ready" as of'August 1983; hopefully this isn''t still the case.  Since I''m using RS232CHAT'to talk to VAX/VMS, emulation of a reasonable term would be very nice ...'I''ve been having problems with the ~Rollmode and ~LocalEcho params on this 'process': "toggling" ~Rollmode doesn''t seem to have any effect; the window 'doesn''t seem to want to scroll (memories of Tek 4014!).  I tried breaking the 'process (#B followed by &uarr;B) and doing a (DSPSCROLL ''ON \RS232CHATWINDOW)':'sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn''t!  Meanwhile, switching from 'RS232CHAT to some other TTY process and then back always seems to screw up'the local echo in the CHAT': typing in "ls" echoes as l[l]s[s] etc.  As with '~Rollmode, ~LocalEcho hs no effect ...'  Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: jonlAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: RS232Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
