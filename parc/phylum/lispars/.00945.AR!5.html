It would be much more useful if it could accept an ATOM as an argument and Capitalize only the first letter of the atom and lowercase all the rest of the letters.  From the documentation in the manual, this is what one would expect (it is also how LOWER and RAISE appear to work).  When given a list, CAP should either only affect the first element of the list or else capitalize only the first character of the first atom and lowering all of the remaining atoms.''--Tom''-----''mjs 5/11/84': 'I also played around with Dedit a bit --- it seems that if you apply CAP to a list, it will capitalize the first word.  If you apply CAP to an atom, it raises it.
