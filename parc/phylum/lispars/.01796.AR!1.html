If you don''t have a copy of the Fugue Release and/or the Carol Release notes, I suggest you contack 1100Support.pasa; these contain the specific directons for making up a cable to connect to the TTYPort.''New Lisp "heads" are available in alpha testing now to use the RS232C port.  Much improved performance.''The Dorado has a parallel port, but we''ve never put in the microcode which makes it accessible to the RS232 routines; even at that, you would still need the parallel-to-serial board that is used with the Dolphin.  If you are serious about using this on the Dorado, please make your intentions known.''-- JonL --'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: JonlAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: RS232Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
