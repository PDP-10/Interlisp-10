This would recur, even though the right password (in the'required lower case) is entered.  Setting \FTPAVAILABLE to NIL and redoing'the operation solves the problem.  Thus, we put this setting in our init'files and "improper" connect does not occur.

Even if you give it the password when it requests it, you get a break.  You should not get any such error writing a file to your own directory.  Please find out if this is the problem, and if so mark this fixed.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 14-Aug-84 12':08':45
