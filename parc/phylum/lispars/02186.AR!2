The following example illustrates.  Create a window containing 6 lines of "ASDF<CR>" as shown':'     ----------------'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !ASDF          !'     !              !'     !              !'     ----------------'Select the entire text and Substitute without query "1234" for "A".  You get the window'     ----------------'     !1234SDF       !'     !1234SDF       !'     !1234SDF       !'     !1234SDF       !'     !              !'     !4SDF          !'     !1234SDF       !'     !1234SDF       !'     !              !'     ----------------'with the first 4 lines selected.  Redisplaying the window makes it look the way it ought to.  Before redisplaying, you can try, but without success, mouse selecting into the misformatted region of the window.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 18-Sep-84 12':30':25
