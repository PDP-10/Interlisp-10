The reason they work differently is because DF says "Edit this as a function", and tries hard to find a function definition, while the "Edit" button attempts to edit it as ''anything'' (e.g., it will look for record definitions). ''I would guess that making Edit presume it is a function should be conditional on it being in a position that a function might be expected, e.g., car of form or within a FUNCTION slot.
