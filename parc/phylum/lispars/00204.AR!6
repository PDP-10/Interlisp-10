I''m using three partitions on my 42 MB disk, Diagnostics (type = debugger) 30000 pages, DSK (type = nonPilot) 20000 pages, and Lisp (type = normal) which takes up the rest.  The sysout I''m starting from is found on {Rosebowl}<lisp>carol>full.sysout.  After that I load {phylum}<Lisp>Library>DLIONFS.DCOM.  Next, I call (MKDIR ''DSK).  This is where it goes wrong.  I see "Opened local disk volume {Diagnostics}" printed in the prompt window, then I get a break window with the message "8935936 - ILLEGAL ARG."

I''m not sure if the types are right.  Please don''t suggest that I use the sysout up on Phylum, because that takes generally over an hour to bring down.  Any ideas?''--Ken.'-------------------------'Rewrote volume file map, volume allocation map, and most of the code under  MKDIR.
