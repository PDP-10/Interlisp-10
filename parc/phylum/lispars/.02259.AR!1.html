Number: 2259Date: 25-Sep-84 12':33':16Submitter: Sannella.PASource: card.paSubject: CHAT[{phylum}] should give "bad host" error, instead of just "failed".Assigned To: Attn: vanMelleStatus: OpenIn/By: Problem Type: Design - UIImpact: ModerateDifficulty: Frequency: Priority: PerhapsSystem: CommunicationsSubsystem: PUP ProtocolsMachine: 1132Disk: Lisp Version: 24-Sep-84 09':49':01Source Files: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: Description: 'Date': 24 Sep 84 16':19 PDT'From': card.pa'Subject': Lisp': Misleading message from chat'To': LispSupport.pa''Lisp System Date': 15-Sep-84 12':54':27'Machine': Dandelion (25200046744)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 5777'Frequency':Always'Impact': Minor''The system response to CHAT({phylum}) is the single word message'"Failed".  The error in this case is that the word phylum has curly brackets around it.  (1) Since the brackets are required in some communications, this is a VERY likely error to make.  (2) The message will mislead many users to assume that it means that the phylum server is down (as it mislead me).''Suggestions':  (1) Since this is a high probability error, the system should check for it explicitly.  Instead of issuing an error message, I think it should just strip off the brackets and do the task without complaint.''(2) In addition, the message should be changed to be more specific so that at least the user can distinguish between an error in the parameter and the failure of the server or the failure of the communication link.  Otherwise, the user will just have to debug his way into discovering this information.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
