If a "changes to':" expression exists in the FileCreated header, this 7-character field smashes "cha" and the right justified integer abuts "nges", making it unparsable by GetFilemap.  As a quick fix, when printing the filemap locator, left justify it with format (FIX 7 NIL NIL T). ''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 27-Aug-84 22':17':15
