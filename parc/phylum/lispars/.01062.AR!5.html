Dlion ucode could be changed for about 0.5% speed down or the stack could be worked on at sysout.''Date': 31 May 84 16':16 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1062': make DLion sysout runnable on Dolphin'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 31 May 84 15':53 PDT'To': Masinter.pa'cc': Sheil.pa, Purcell.pa, vanMelle.pa, Charnley.pa''I believe we can fake it fairly easily by having Lisp.run look at the MachineType entry in the InterfacePage; if Dandelion, then set a prearranged location in InterfacePage to a prearranged flag value, and start Lisp by doing a context switch to the hardreset context.  After the reset finishes, and the process world gets going, it notices the magic flag, suspends everyone except the exec, tells the exec to run the afterxxx events, then let everyone run.''This is a coordinated change between Lisp.run and PROC, possibly LLFAULT and LLKEY as well, difficulty Moderate.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date:  4-Jun-84 14':11':26</pre>
