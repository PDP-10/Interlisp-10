You may specify the existence, location, and font of page numbers, and the number, width, and separation of columns on the page, as well as margins all around.''You may specify separate sets of the above values for each of three classes of pages':  The first page,  all other left-hand (verso) pages, and all other right-hand (recto) pages.  These all assume that the pages are to be printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.''To set these, hit the "Page Formatting" button in the TEdit expanded menu.  That brings up a second menu which lets you examine and set the page layouts.  Generally, the values in that menu are in picas, of which there are 6 to the inch--user-specifiable units are in the queue.''The default page layout is now one-inch margins all around, with no page number on the first page, and page numbers 1/2" from the top alternating left and right sides thereafter.''There is also a functional interface to page layout,''  (TEDIT.PAGELAYOUT stream layout)''will set the page layout specs for the given text stream.  "layout" is either a single page''s worth of layout, or a complete specification.  To specify layout for a single class of page, use the function''(TEDIT.SINGLE.PAGEFORMAT Page#s? Pg#X Pg#Y Pg#Font Pg#Alignment Top Bottom Left Right #Cols ColWidth InterColSpace Units)''returns a PAGEREGION describing the page layout requested.'	Page#s?':  T if you want page numbers on this kind of page, else NIL.'	Pg#X':  The horizontal location of the page number.  Negative values are measured from the right margin.'	Pg#Y':  The vertical location of the base line for the page numbers.  Negative values are measured from the top of the page.'	Pg#Font':  The font to be used to display the page numbers.  This can be any specification that is acceptable to TEDIT.LOOKS.'	Pg#ALignment':  Tells how the page number is to be aligned on the location you gave for it.  ''LEFT means your location is the lower, left corner of the page number.  ''RIGHT means your location is the lower, right corner.  ''CENTERED means you want the page number centered around the point you specified.'	Top':  The top margin'	Bottom':  The bottom margin'	Left':  The left margin'	Right':  The right margin'	#Cols': Number of columns (default 1)'	ColWidth': Column width (default is to evenly divide the available space between left and right margins)'	InterColSpace':  The space between the right edge of one column, and the left edge of the next column.  Defaults to evenly divide the space left after the columns are set up.  If there is more than one column, YOU MUST SPECIFY ONE OR THE OTHER OF ColWidth and InterColSpace!'	Units':  The units used in setting the values you specified.  May be one of the atoms PICAS, IN, INCHES, CM, POINTS.  Default is PICAS.''Once you have build a PAGEREGION description for each of the 3 classes of page, you can create a composite page layout for your document by calling''(TEDIT.COMPOUND.PAGEFORMAT first recto verso)''with the three respective page-class layout descriptions.  Then call TEDIT.PAGEFORMAT with that result.''NOTE': This interface is interim only; it will be expanded and altered in the future to give access to greater power for laying out pages.''*EXPANDED MENU is now split into 4 sub menus.  Hitting the "Expanded Menu" item in the TEdit menu now brings up a small "core" menu, with the most common operations.  From that menu, you can get to 3 auxiliary menus, for character-looks, paragraph-looks, and page-layout.  These menus scroll independently, and stay around until closed.''- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -'Known problems':''If one expanded menu is closed, it may leave a gap between the main window and other expanded menus for that same edit window.''- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -'''	--The TEdit Implementors''-----''Date': 14 Aug 84 10':00 PDT'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': ----- New TEdit Released -----'To': TEditFriends^.pa, LispFriends^.pa'cc': TEditSupport.pa''There is a new TEdit available on {ERIS}<Lispcore>Library>, whose TEDITSYSTEMDATE is 13-Aug-84 21':16.

A small gray square will appear in the left margin next to the paragraph''s first line, to warn you that there''s something you can''t see about this paragraph.
