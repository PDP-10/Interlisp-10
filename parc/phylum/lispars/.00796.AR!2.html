PC in MOVEATTACHEDWINDOWTOPLACE was 1321.  ATWIN and MAINW were both windows, EDGE was TOP, POSONEDGE was JUSTIFY, MAINWEXTENT was a region, EXTENT was NIL.  Don''t know what other information would help.''--Ron''-----''Date': 20 Apr 84 11':47 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Lafite': MORE ON ANSWER PROBLEM'To': LafiteSupport.pa'cc': Kaplan.pa''I couldn''t get out of the SHOULDNT break.  STOP and &uarr; simply got me back into it, as did &uarr;D and RESET.  I tried the PSW, found the MESSAGEANSWER process and tried to Kill it.  I was told that "Can''t kill the TTY process".''Don''t understand why that was the TTY process.  The caret wasn''t blinking in its window.  THe caret was in the top-level tty window.''What''s goin'' on?''--Ron''-----''Date': 20 Apr 84 11':50 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Lafite': ANOTHER FOOTNOTE ON ANSWER'To': LafiteSupport.pa''I explicitly moved the KBD&larr; to the Exec process, then was able to Kill the MESSAGEANSWER.  However, I now can''t get rid of its window.  Tried buttoning abort, and the abort button greyed out, but nothing happened.  The close command is a no-op, so it seems that I''m stuck with that window (except for moving it almost off the screen).''One other observation':  The window when it came up had the deliver button greyed out.''--Ron''-----''Date': 20 Apr 84 11':54 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Lafite': STILL MORE'To': LafiteSupport.pa''Tried the Move command to move the window off the screen.  I got a ghost region that was much much larger than the actual size of the window, nearly the whole screen.  I was able to move the window off to a corner (mostly off the screen), then I tried another MOVE to see whether the region was still bad.  It was, but this time I ended up with a break in DOUSERFNS2 inside REDISPLAYW inside MOVEW.''It was a NON-NUMERIC ARG NIL break inside \SLOWIGREATERP inside \SETCARET inside \SHOWSEL inside \TEDIT.REPAINTFN.  Args to \SETCARET were X=NIL and Y=NIL.''--Ron''------'Date': 14 Aug 84 15':00 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'To': Kaplan''I''m declining this one.  Sounds like cosmic rays in attachedwindow.  Haven''t seen anything like it since.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 14-Aug-84 15':35':14</pre>
