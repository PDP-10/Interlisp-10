It''s frequently helpful, especially in SUBTITUTE to see more context than just the one line in question.''Also, I noticed in the old TEDIT that SUBSTITUTE wouldn''t mark (underline) its subject string if it was in the top line in the display.  I haven''t been able to get SUBSTITUTE to work in the new Tedit to see if this is still true.''-----''Date': 10 May 84 13':49 PDT'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': AR 634 -- FIND, SUSTITUTE should center selection'To': Wallace'cc': TEditsupport.pa''I''ve thought about this, and have marked the suggestion DECLINED.
