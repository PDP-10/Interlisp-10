So it seems clearly in Tedit''s domain.  On the other hand, you might add an AR wish for all three microcodes, "GCREF should not cause invalid address for pointers out of bounds".'DLion uCode doesn''t do this.  -- don''DLion uCode does do it, but this AR has been superceded, since the stack parser maps things into a valid range before calling GCREF.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 12':05':52
