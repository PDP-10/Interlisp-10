''In general, the model of HARDCOPYW is that "you''ve got to be able to show it'on the screen before you can print it."  ''This is, of course, all wrong.''It would be really nice to be able to print structures that are larger than the screen.  Jeff''s example of huge graph structures is a good one.  Interlisp allows you to scroll, but you don''t have that option w/ hardcopy.  (I also have this same problem with Intercalc spread sheets.  I imagine VLSI people would want the same thing.)''So how about it, LispSupport?  Can we get someone to write a "display structure to press/interpress" converter so such things can be printed?  (I understand the problems with converting bitmaps...  But graphs aren''t bitmaps internally...)  Can we have scaling on the resulting image?  How about breaking up such big images into multi-page format?  (e.g. the NetWorld topology map)  How about matching scale to physical printer size (I''m thinking of the huge Versatec printers)?

HARDCOPYW is fixed as follows': ''if the window has a HARDCOPYFN field, then let the HARDCOPYFN do the printing''otherwise, if the window has no HARDCOPYFN, then if it has a REDISPLAYFN, call the redisplayfn with the window as one argument, and a DIG output stream which is where it is supposed to redisplay''otherwise, hardcopy the window''s bitmap as is done currently''-----''Date':  5 May 84 14':30 PDT'From': AHenderson.pa'Subject': Re': Adirondack / Printing grapher windows'In-reply-to': DMRussell.PA''s message of 4 May 1984 9':06 am PDT (Friday)'To': DMRussell.PA'cc': Shrager, Ahenderson, Jordan, ari^, LispSupport''Dan':''I believe that David Snyder <DSnyder.Henr> has something like that working in Rochester in conjunction with his documentation of Trillium.''Austin ''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date:  7-May-84 15':01':55Attn: Jellinek, Kapl, BurtAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [lmm 7 May': changed to Jellinek because of DIG]System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
