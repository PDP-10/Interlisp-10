The function SETSPELLCASE sets it up. On some of our keyboards, however, the special characters are on different keytops. ''The system shold reset SETSPELLCASE depending on the keyboard you are on.''The SPELLCASEARRAY feature should be documented so that users can modify it.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  4-Jun-84 14':46':15Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: DWIMMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 8191File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
