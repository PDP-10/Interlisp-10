I find the caret winding up in P1''s window rather than in DEDIT''s buffer window on the second edit.  Among other clues to this problem, I find that the PROCESS WINDOWPROP of the main DEDIT window does not get reset from P1 to P2 by the second DF invocation.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  7-Aug-84 15':45':30Attn: SHEILAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
