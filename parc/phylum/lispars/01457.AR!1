Further, the manual says (p. 2.32) that Interlisp-10 and Interlisp/VAX  "provide a much more primitive version of arrays than other implementations".  This statement certainly isn''t informative, and not particularly accurate since Interlisp-D doesn''t support mixed arrays.  I suggest just mentioning that there are some incompatibilities.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 18-Jun-84 14':07':11Attn: Sannella,JonL,KaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: DocumentationSubsystem: Interlisp Reference ManualMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
