It worked fine so I compiled it and saved it on a file.  Then later I reloaded it but when I tried to execute that function, it thought it only took two arguments - ie. breaking the function and asking ?= only showed values for two arguments.  I then did a trivial edit (changing a comment) and the function then worked OK again.  The function is TISOUND on {Ice}&lt;Denber&gt;Lisp&gt;PLAYD0PATCH.DCOM;3 if you want to try to duplicate this.''			- Michel''-----''Date':  1 Jun 84 11':53 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': TISOUND  on [ice]&lt;denber&gt;lisp&gt;playd0patch'To': denber.wbst, LispSupport''I was just getting around to looking at AR#814. It seems pretty clear that the problem is that TISOUND didn''t get recompiled. What did you do when you "compiled it and saved it on a file"?''I suspect that what happened is that you did COMPILE(TISOUND) and then did a MAKEFILE(PLAYD0PATCH (RC ST] or some such, but that with RECOMPILEDEFAULT=EXPRS, it didn''t recompile the function. ''Does that jive with your recollection?''-----''Date':  1 Jun 84 16':33 EDT'From': Denber.wbst'Subject': Re': TISOUND  on [ice]&lt;denber&gt;lisp&gt;playd0patch'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 1 Jun 84 11':53 PDT'To': Masinter.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa''It is likely that I did say (COMPILE ''TISOUND) at some point prior to saving the file on disk.  To do the latter, I always call (CLEANUP) with whatever its default options are (ST, I believe).''To tell you the truth, this is all so long ago now I don''t even remember what the original problem was supposed to be.  What I *would* like to find out is why I keep getting Leaf error 111''s (file busy) when I do a MAKEFILE after a DELFILE of the same file.''			- Michel'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':33':40</pre>
