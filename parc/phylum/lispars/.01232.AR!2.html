It''s not entirely obvious to me exactly what the difference is between the several implementations of MACROS.  The different ways are'	LAMBDA or NLAMBDA'	NIL expression or list expression'	OPENLAMBDA'	etc.'What does each do?  How about more examples of each, and not just of odd cases (I''m referring to the example at the top of page 5.19, that uses recursion).''Just some suggestions.''--Ken.''-----''Date': 21 MAY 84 23':39 PDT'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': suggestions for MACRO documentation'To':   feuerman.pasa'cc':   lispsupport''Thanks, Ken. I think your suggestions are reasonable. I''ve revised macro handling a little and I think that we should definitely rewrite the macro chapter -- most other Lisp dialects really ''play up'' macros.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 16':12':53</pre>
