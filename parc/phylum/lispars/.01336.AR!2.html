The main change is that you can now sysin from another partition on the same machine, as well as from a remote Pup server.  Syntax is the same as from within Lisp.  E.g., you can say to the exec''&gt;Lisp {DSK5}FOO.SYSOUT'' or even''&gt;Lisp {DSK3}Lisp.virtualmem''Enterprising users will notice that this latter command effectively gives you "checkpoint" and "rollback" by using the Lisp.virtualmem on a second partition as the checkpoint image.  As with inside Lisp, the partition number requested must be less than or equal to 7.''Fitting this feature in required some substantial changes to the sysin code; let me know if you encounter problems.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':36':13Attn: Assigned To: vanMelle.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Dolphin/Dorado DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: ClosedProblem Type: Source Files: </pre>
