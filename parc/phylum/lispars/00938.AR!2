''STKSCAN(var) takes the atom (can be assumed to be litatom, since it is checked before every entry) and returns the pointer (hiloc,loloc) to where the atom is bound, if any. If not bound on the stack, it returns its global value location. It doesn''t even look at the value in the location it finds. ''STKSCAN is not ''user callable'', but rather is used by SET, SETQ, BOUNDP.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: CharnleyEdit-Date: 25-Sep-84 11':04':41
