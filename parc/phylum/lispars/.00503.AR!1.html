Bits then'get sent to the wrong window.'     (3) Given the slowness of AISBLT, its uninterruptability is'unfortunate.  Couldn''t AISBLT be made interruptable at convenient points?'     (4) I had a lot of difficulty guessing what a FILTER was supposed'to be.  Finally I figured out it had to be an array size 256, origin 0,'with values between 0 &amp; 255.  Maybe this should be documented.'				Kelly'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: LibraryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
