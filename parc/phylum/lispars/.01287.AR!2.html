How to reproduce it':''Do (OVERFLOW T).'Then, in an empty Tedit, move the mouse through the left edge of the screen, moving right-to-left.  This pops up the scroll window and then causes an immediate divide-by-zero error.''At this point the mouse has the keyboard.  You can uparrow the break window(s) and even (carefully, from the left) close the dead scroll window.  The mouse still has the tty.''david'---------'The divide by zero error was caught.  I don''t know what this was doing to cause the mouse to get and keep the tty but this doesn''t seem like the place to chase it.''richard''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: burton.paEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 18':23':44</pre>
