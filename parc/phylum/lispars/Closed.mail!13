I beleive I used to be able to stop most functions with control D, but now it is just ignored.  Moreover, after a function has completed there are several ^D's printed in the toplevel window.  After I initiate (INTERRUPTCHAR T), this problem seems to disppear.2) When I break on a function, backtrace, and dedit a funtion on the BT list, the value of the variables within that function return nobind when evaluated.  I haven't any idea how to work around this.3) When printing to a product printer I haven't been able to get  HARDCOPYW's rotation to make any difference.  The printout is always landscape.  Also I haven't seen a hook to change or suppress the title message "Window Screen Image".  Suggestion:Could we have the break window push to the top after editing a function throught the backtrace menu ?  Sometimes I've burried the break window with my edit window (I have DEditLinger T) and have to close or bury the edit window to get back to the break window.  Having it return to the top will also call attention to it.Tim Bigham*start*00518 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 31 Mar 84 13:40 PSTFrom: Wallace.paSubject: Lisp: Manditory file versionsTo: LispSupport.paLisp-System-Date:  1-Mar-84 14:24:22Machine-Type: DoradoI would like to have a recognition mode (i.e. EXACT) that would allow me to specify a destination filename without version numbers.

The initial value for FIXSPELL.UPPERCASE.QUIET is NIL, which turns OFF the feature (making the system work differently than it does now.)The edit was quite trivial; there was a special clause in FIXSPELL which implemented this feature, and I just wrapped a (AND FIXSPELL.UPPERCASE.QUIET --) around it.I'm uncertain whether to document the variable, or just to announce that the system behavior changed.I'm working from home and don't trust the maxc version of the compiler any more ; so I've merely stored the updated source of SPELL on <LispCore>Sources> without the corresponding SPELL.DCOM.

Mainly it is a little extra hair in the keyboard handler where it decodes the mouse "keys".  It needs to have a state machine and a timer so that it can decide if left and right go down close enough in time to be considered "simultaneous" and hence be treated as middle.  To handle the few cases of chording we have, you have to decide how to interpret left+right followed by one of left or right going up.  This seems entirely tractable to me.  The penalty of it all is principally some extra overhead in the keyhandler, but that can probably be arranged to occur only, or principally, on mouse transitions.	Bill*start*00785 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  1 Apr 84 22:42 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: On Closing a browser.In-reply-to: Ahenderson.pa's message of 31 Mar 84 11:29 PSTTo: Ahenderson.pacc: LafiteSupport.paIf indeed no Update needs to be done, then Close does not ask.  I suspect what you're observing is that Lafite considers Update needed if the file does not have an up to date table of contents (you browsed the file and it had to parse it first).  Even though nothing else changed, Lafite wants to write out a toc file so that next time you browse the file it is easier.  Not sure how to best handle this, except perhaps for Lafite to remember "toc needed" as a separate case from "Update needed" and prompt accordingly.	Bill*start*00825 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 Apr 84 08:33 PSTFrom: Sannella.paSubject: [kaplan.pa: Re: AR 411: UNIX file names don't work with UNPACKFILENAME]To: LispSupport.pa     ----- Forwarded Messages -----From: kaplan.paDate: 31-Mar-84 21:25:18 PSTSubject: Re: AR 411: UNIX file names don't work with UNPACKFILENAMEIn-reply-to: Your message of 31 Mar 84 14:08:41 PST (Saturday)To: SannellaThis should be passed on to someone else.

At every \PERIODIC.INTERRUPT I uninterruptably (replace (INTERRUPTSTATE INTCHARCODE) of \INTERRUPTSTATEwith (CHARCODE ^S)) and (SETQ \PENDING.INTERRUPT T).  When the periodic interrupt goes away, I get a lisp software interrupt.  Forclass SCHEDULER, INTERRUPTED was redefined to call the function SCHEDULER,which does something like suspend and wake various processes.  The peopletrying to use this stuff are simulating a data acquisition system in whichprocesses have various priorities, and are using their own prioritymechanism, rather than trying to use those parts of PROCESSWORLD prioritieswhich are implemented.The other benefit from this code is that with \PERIODIC.INTERRUPT turnedoff, I can still force a block during a non-blocking computation simply bytyping ^S.And yes, it's very dangerous and things still crash now and then, butit's sufficient to simulate our systems.Eric-------------------------------------------------------------------     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*01080 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 Apr 84 09:09 PSTFrom: Sannella.paSubject: [Masinter.pa: [vanMelle.pa: Re: two little addenda]]To: LispSupport.pa     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Date: 30 Mar 84 15:42 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: [vanMelle.pa: Re: two little addenda]To: LispCore^fyi     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Date:  1 Jan 84 16:52 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: two little addendaIn-reply-to: JONL.PA's message of 1 JAN 84 03:42 PSTTo: JONL.PAcc: LispCore^.PAThere is a much easier, less grody, and of course, official, way to make an arbitrary function FOO undoable on typein: define a function /FOO that is an undoable version of FOO, and then add (FOO . /FOO) to the variable LISPXFNS.

Larry and I had different conceptions of the way it should be, and the result probably fell somewhere in the middle.All that aside, I wouldn't be surprised if this problem is due to the fact that HARDCOPYW is somehow constructing an Interpress file, but then attempting to print it as a press file, perhaps because the extension of the file is .PRESS.Right now, Gregg might be the best bet for this.--Ron*start*00437 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 Apr 84 12:13 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: AR#442: improve documentation of DLion keyboardTo: 1100Support.pasacc: LispSupportThis looks like an action item for 1100Support: the guide you give to users should definitely tell them what DLion keys correspond to what Dolphin keys.

Of course, an additional optional argument would be added to the user-level functions so that the automatic default could be overrided with an explicit OS name.Amongst the other kinds of problems it would solve are the automaticuppercasification of file names (some file systems are case-sensitive, andothers alledgedly aren't); and possibly the EXACT feature wanted by Gumbyand Roach.Whether or not I could work on this problem is dependent on the priority ofthe other items on my queue.*start*00839 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 APR 84 13:04 PSTFrom: JONL.PASubject: Re: [Masinter.pa: [vanMelle.pa: Re: two little addenda]]To:   Sannella, LispSupportcc:   JONL, LispCore^In response to the message sent   2 Apr 84 09:09 PST from Sannella.paLarry sent out a message after forwarding the note of 1 Jan 84 below sayingthat he didn't mean to do it -- his finger slipped while having severaldifferent mail browsers open.The basic problem here is that LISPXFNS isn't documented, and probablydoesn't need to be.

But there areseveral problems with trying to use it in Interlisp -- 1) The basic problem it "solves" is that it "compiles a program to cons   up the structure" rather than doing the copy thing like SUBST/SUBLIS/SUBPAIR   do.  But with the interpreter and compiler "caching" macro expansions in   CLISPARRAY, there seems to be little need for extra speed; in the Common    Lisp world, there is no pervasive mechanism like CLISPARRAY (but provisions    for an automatic "caching scheme" on a mcaro-by-macro basis).2) With the varying contents of the T readtable, EDITRDTBL, FILERDTBL, etc,   one can't use the macrocharacter everywhere -- thus he is left with a   "hybrid" system, where he must expect to put BQUOTE in some places, but   "," in others.  There is a long-standing desire on the part of some of   us up here to homogenize the various readtables, so that PQUOTE and some   version of a backquote can be made standard (including being printed out    with the backquote notation rather than with "BQUOTE" by prettyprint).3) The "backquote" notion came out of the MacLisp world (now generall called   the Common Lisp world) where the most common use was in macro-producing   macros; given the character and treatment of macros in Interlisp, there   seems to virtually no place (or instances of usages) of macro-producing   macros.  However, as your example shows, there are some legitimate usages   that are not related to macros.  Nevertheless, there are at least three    "bugs" with the current Interlisp design that make it incompatible with   the Common Lisp one, so if one has had some experience in the Common Lisp    world, he will likely want to load in Kelly Roach's Library package called    BQUOTE.*start*00983 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Sender: Sannella.PADate:  2 Apr 84 12:58:01 PST (Monday)Subject: Re: Lisp: PROMPTREMINDERSIn-reply-to: Denber.wbst's message of 2 Apr 84 12:19 ESTTo: Denber.wbstcc: JONL, LispSupportFrom: LispSupportRe: Ah of course - that's better, but I still have the problem of wanting to eval *now* something that has to be inside a QUOTE.

Our own installation is acting as a testsite for this support, and has just been through a Xerox customersupport operation.  We have come out of it in worse shape thanbefore it all started.  I want to detail what happened so thatthe situation can be remedied and perhaps prevented in thefuture.The Saga (as best I can remember it)The weekend before this last one our printer (an 8045) went downand would not boot.  On Monday I dutifully called the local BSGoffice, and was told that the appropriate person would get rightback to me.  Within ten minutes another person had called andimmediately sized up the problem and its solution:  reload oursoftware.Unfortunately, we had not been given software with our printer,and so were told to contact XSIS and acquire it.  I then calledPasadena, and ended up talking to Clay Agadoni.  He said, ofcourse we should have gotten the software, and asked how muchmemory our printer had (1.5 megabytes).  He then put me in touchwith Joan Phillips, the specialist in printers.  She wasn't in atthat moment and would get back in touch.Tuesday.  I reached Joan.  She also immediately figured out theproblem and said that the floppies and documentation on how touse them would be in the mail right away.Wednesday came and no floppies.  A call to Joan yielded theresponse that the documentation had caused the package to go outthat morning, by Express Mail, so we should get them Thursdaymorning.  Later Wednesday Rob Ferrar called (he's in our nearestXSIS service center in Rosslyn, Virginia).  He said that he wouldhave to come up to install the software and would also change ourmemory size back to the standard, since the error seemed to beone that he had recently seen, and related to thelarger-than-standard memory.  He would be here Thursday morning.Thursday came, but no Rob.  The Washington area had been hit byan unusual snowstorm and all airports were closed.  He would tryfor Friday (and would have to juggle his schedule to do it).Friday.  Rob arrived, and converted our printer from 1.5M to384Kbytes; he loaded all the services software, and many fonts.Unfortunately, our tests of listfiles appeared to print out blankpages, though window prints and snapshots worked.  Rob had toleave (the weather was looking somewhat ominous).  The floppiesfrom Joan containing the services software arrived in theafternoon.ObservationsFirst, it is important to point out that our perceptions are thatall the individuals involved were quite helpful.  As individualsthey are intelligent and knowledgeable, with an attitude thatsays "customer support."However, there seems to be some higher-level problems that makeXerox support not as comforting as it could be.  A customershould never be told by one Xerox organization that he has to gotalk to another Xerox organization!  There should be one contactpoint within Xerox that does the routing, if that's needed.On another level, our printer also runs our Clearinghouse.  Thus,if we had not had a backup means for the Clearinghouse, ourentire development crew would have been out of business fornearly a week.With the smaller amount of memory, the printer takes much longerto operate (up to twice as slow for the time between getting thedocument and starting to print).  The rationale that the smallermemory would cause fewer crashes doesn't take into account thefact that we had been operating the printer satisfactorily forabout 8 months prior to all this.  And the new slowness sent ourcrew up the walls, since they had backlogged printing for theweek.Finally, while we supposedly now have 59 fonts (according to theprinter), it has been traumatic for us lispers.  Our fontdefssettings just no longer worked.  After a large amount ofexploration I found that we have the following lisp-accessiblefonts:	        Classic:  8,10,12,14,24 point sizes	Modern:        12        Gacha:  6,8,10,12	There are a variety of others (PRINTWHEEL, etc.)  that I have noidea how to get to.  I might point out that in this interactionwe lost fonts we had before, such as other sizes of Modern.Gacha is nice to have, since we had been struggling with onlyvariable width fonts.  We had asked about Gacha, had been told itwas an extra cost option, and were waiting for the price.  Thereare some problems with this Gacha, however:  it is missingcharacters 34, 94, 95, 96, and all those above 127.  Thesecharacters are (in ASCII) ", _, ^, and accent-grave.  Itssomewhat difficult to read lisp code without the first two ofthese.The characters above 127 are a different problem.  Xerox hasstandardized its fonts on some international standard (not ASCII,but similar).  This doesn't cause much of a problem, and thenormal Interpress routines translate ^ and _ to some code greaterthan 127.  (Either way we can't print these characters in Gacha.)But we also can't print $, which has also been moved from itsstandard ASCII position.  We had asked Xerox some time ago forlisp to be cognizant of this particular switch, and the answerwas to advise the relevent printout functions, which we did.Having Gacha not conform to Xerox's own standard makes it ratherdifficult for us to use it.  I might note that $ is particularlyrelevent to financial applications.The net result of all this is that after a service call, we arein worse shape than before!  Our printing takes much longer, wedon't have the fonts we were using, and the whole disaster tooknearly a week.  I do not believe that XSIS or Xerox wouldperceive this as a good example of customer support.Action items:1.  Re-install the 1.5M memory immediately.  We prefer theenvironment we've been working with for 8 months.  I will tradethe extra productivity for the more-often crashes, and I'm notsure it crashes more often.2.  Clean up the font picture.  What are the fonts we (or anyoneelse) should have?  What fonts does Interlisp know about?  Whenwill there be similar fonts for printer and display?  and isthere one fixed-width font we can use?  [a Xerox standard shouldbe adhered to]3.  Devise some structure that does not have us working thru morethan one Xerox sub-organization.*start*00524 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 Apr 84 16:44 PSTFrom: Dering.pasaSubject: Re: AR270 (GETD 'FLOPPY.MODE) = NILIn-reply-to: ROACH.PA's message of 2 APR 84 11:53 PSTTo: ROACH.PAcc: LISPSUPPORT.PA, DERING.PASA Kelly,I was able to reproduce the problem I described several times.Were you using the March 13 Sysout?

Those who have tried this modification find it much easier to select messages and not get confused by the message mark region.  As before, you can select a message by clicking anywhere in its summary line (except in the small mark region, where clicking enters the change mark mode).  Should there turn out to be popular demand for the old behavior, I may be forced to control it with a flag, but see how you like this way first.For those of you who don't like to wait for Hardcopy to finish, or don't like losing every third of your 1-message-at-a-time listings because someone walked off with your hardcopy attached to the back of a big listing, or just are offended at the waste of paper involved, there is a new flag: LAFITEHARDCOPYBATCHFLG.  When this flag is true, Lafite "batches" your hardcopy requests, and doesn't actually print them until you do an Update, at which point it sends them all to the printer in one batch.  When you have hardcopy pending, the Hardcopy button is speckled to remind you of this fact.  The Update button has an additional choice "Do Hardcopy Only" in case you want to get your batched hardcopy printed without doing an actual Update.  The behavior of LAFITENEWPAGEFLG when batching hardcopy is that it applies only to the messages selected at each Hardcopy invocation; each new set of messages starts on a new page, independent of the setting of LAFITENEWPAGEFLG.The Lisp/Lafite/Tedit report forms now have some additional information in them to aid the AR database.Message senders no longer vanish on a HardReset.  They don't come back to life (this awaiting a future release), but they do stay open and change their title to "dead message editor".	Bill*start*00419 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 Apr 84 17:57 PSTFrom: Nuyens.paSubject: Re: Lisp: NOW is being bound!In-reply-to: JONL.PA's message of 16 MAR 84 11:18 PSTTo: JONL.PAcc: Nuyens.PA, LispSupport.PAThe problem is simply that \LASTUSERACTION is destructively changed.

Afterall, it could well have been a bug -- the situation with ARCSIN of SIN,for example, was similar! and it takes a little analysis to determinewhich is the Poor-Approximation and which is the Inherent-Instability.HORNERIFY is merely a shorthand way of writing out a polynomial evaluation --it exists as a non-exported macro in AARITH and takes a form like    (HORNERIFY a[n] X a[n-1] . . . a2 a1 a0)into the appropriate composition of FPLUS and FTIMES to evaluate the polynomial    a[n]X^n + a[n-1]X^(n-1) + . . .  + a1X + a0using, of course, horners rule for order of calculations.The brunt of the work for numerical approximation is to find a transformationof the argument domain into some limited domain under which a polynomialapproximation has desirable "closeness" to the function.  There exist methodsfor generating polynomials with minimum "max error" over the range, and thereexist methods for generating polynomials with minimum integral of error overthe domain.  As you can imagine, a few points with large error can still bequite acceptable to the latter method.*start*00314 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 APR 84 20:58 PSTFrom: JONL.PASubject: Re: AR 167: more commentsTo:   JONL, LispSupportIn response to the message sent   2 APR 84 19:08 PST from JONL.PAThe middle paragraph of the aforementioned message has a bearing onAR 211.*start*01252 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  2 Apr 84 19:49 PSTFrom: JonL.paSubject: AR 460 -- user wants handle on "Top level typescript window"To: vanMelle.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Le.pasa, JonL.paIt may be that the luser hasn't fully grasped the notion of a tty window for each process, but it shouldn't be a "sin" for several proceses to be dropping printout into the same window -- rather the coordination of such should be the programmer responsibility (with monitor locks, or strategy, or "nothing" if that's ok).

The reason is that the screen Star fonts--and the NSFonts widths files--all obey the STAR character code set instead of the NS code set.  Thus, hyphen and dollar sign have the right width.Until we get real NS support, I have no good schemes for how to handle the problem in general; perhaps we should just create our own version of the star build-a-font-file tool to do the conversions.*start*03715 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 20 Mar 84 12:07:57 PST (Tuesday)From: JFung.pasaSubject: Re: Summaries of LispARs/LispAR-Submit.FormIn-reply-to: Sannella.pa's message of 19 Mar 84 20:20 PSTTo: LispSupport.pacc: 1100Support, Le, Sannella.pa, JFungI think it is good to have some defined AR files generated periodically.  I have some inputs, I think to use Adobe to its full extent power, we must be careful of identifying some key fields which when submitted, their value should not be omitted.  I went thru some ARs and found a lot fields missing.  Minor fileds are OK, but some like Impact, Assigned To, Priority are very important.   As the implementators at PARC, you probably only concern with ARs assigned to you.  Without having "Assigned To" filled in AR, it is difficult to get this information. I have created a LispAR-Submit.Form which has all the current fields in Submit window.  The purpose of this form is to use as a mail-file, people have no access to Tajo/Adobe can send this form to their designated submitters.  I recommend those fields with ** are mandatory, they have to be set.Regarding about sorted AR files, I feel one sorted by Priority/asscending and Impact/asscending would be very usefule. Remember all ARs with priority Absoultely must be fixed prior to next release.  (We are lucky that  enumerated fileds in Priority: {Absolutely, Hopefully, Perhaps, Unlikely} are in the order of we want.)By the way, your press file have a lot of control characters at the end, (residue from TEDIT??), I dont know whether they will be printed ok inside Interlisp, but it sure created a LOT of pages when printed under Tajo. ------------------------------------------------------------Subject: LispAR-Submit.FormTo: Le.pasa, Sannella.pacc: myself--filed at [Rose]<Lisp>Adobe>LispAR-Submit.FormSOURCE**: 	Name.pasaSYSTEM/SUBSYSTEM**: 	Communications NS Protocols;

The characters that are printed out by IPBOUTCHARCODE are measured as they go by, which isn't so cool if you are printing out the charset shift, the new charset number, etc. in this way.Seems like here, and perhaps other places, we have to measure the width of the original 16 bit code (how do we do that?) before we print it out.This might not matter in MAKEINTERPRESS, but INTERPRESS.OUTCHARFN and perhaps IP.PRIN3 really do care about this.--Ron*start*00536 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 20 Mar 84 23:53 PSTFrom: Wallace.paSubject: Lafite: Selecting/deleting messages by referenceTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Wallace.paLafite-System-Date: 28-Feb-84 13:10:33Lisp-System-Date:  1-Mar-84 14:24:22Machine-Type: DoradoIf I get a reply to some message, it contains an In-reply-to field referencing my query.

If you have an exception, it would be interesting to see the details, so we can plug the leak (if, indeed, the problem is at the Lisp end).	Bill*start*01197 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 18 MAR 84 17:19 PSTFrom: JONL.PASubject: Re: Floating arith optimizatioTo:   kaplan, lispsupportcc:   JONLIn response to the message sent  18-Mar-84  9:31:15 PST from kaplan.paThese factors, 2 to 5, of course apply only to the low-level functions mentioned, but in some cases these do add up to a surprising overall performance degradation;  it all just goes to show critical even one "leaky hole in the dike" can be.

Two main points spring to mind:1) ucode, where possible, should do the coercions.  The compiler simply   can't optimize out cases like (FPLUS X Y) where X is fixp and Y floatp.2) system code, such as on AARITH etc, should not depend upon these   sometime compiler/ucode optimizations.

This was accomplished by dis-assembling the RSX ethernet driver (yes, they only left us the .TSK files), and then making improvements to the driver.   The major improvement was greatly increasing the speed of the transfer of the ethernet packet from the task buffer to the driver buffer (A driver buffer is necessary as the Xerox hardware can only DMA to the low 64 Kbytes).   Now we are getting transfers in both directions at 10.5 Kbits/sec. and the RSX system is nearly always busy during the transfer.   Anyone who might profit from this is invited to mail me, Hal Brand - BRAND@LLL-MFE.ARPA, and I will be glad to provide any and all details.   My thanks to all who responded about the problem.   The notion that multiple packets we sent to the RSX machine gave me the confidence to spend the time to dis-assemble the driver in an effort to increase its through-put so as not to allow the 2nd packet to be missed.   I am no pretty sure that the problem was that the RSX handler was so slow that the 2nd packet was lost by RSX and then the dolphin had to wait 3 to 5 seconds to time-out the response to the 2nd packet before re-transmitting it.   Again, my thanks to all.							Hal Brand							BRAND@LLL-MFE.ARPA*start*00501 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: Thu, 15 Mar 84 18:04 PSTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: Re: Lisp: XSIS Network Consulting database?In-reply-to: "Sybalsky.pa's message of 15 Mar 84 11:20 PST"To: Sybalsky.pacc: LispSupport.pa, 1100SupportJohn,We do not have a "mechanism" per se.

In particular, if it asked for the time andgot back a packet that addressed it by the correct net number, it wouldbelieve it.  You say the reply has the correct net & host numbers, butdid you mean correct in the source or in the destination fields?  It ispossible that your time server is simply "turning around" the requestpacket, but not filling in the unknown fields.  For example, the requestwould have had Source address = 0#xxx#yyy; simply turning that aroundwould produce a reply with Destination address = 0#xxx#yyy instead of21#xxx#yyy.The standard practice of most low-level pup software is to fill in suchunknown fields (if the recipient knows them) before passing the packeton to higher-level software.  If this were done in the time server case,then when the server swapped the source and destination addresses, thenet number would have gotten filled in correctly.If this is not the problem, we'd need more information.  In particular,you say only that your Dolphin Alto exec didn't know the net number.Did Lisp?Problem reports are seen more quickly by 1100Support if you send yourquery directly to us at 1100Support.pasa@Parc-maxc, rather than to1100users@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA.*start*00907 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Received: from SUMEX-AIM.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA; 15 MAR 84 11:45:23 PSTReturn-path: <@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA:obrien@rand-unix>Redistributed: Xerox1100UsersGroup^.PAReceived: from rand-unix by SUMEX-AIM.ARPA with TCP; Thu 15 Mar 84 10:48:20-PSTDate: Thu, 15 Mar 84 10:46 PSTTo: kiewiet.PASACc: 1100Support.PASA, 1100users@SUMEX-AIM.ARPASubject: Re: How do Dolphins determine net number?In-reply-to: Your message of Thu, 15 Mar 84 10:00 PST.From: obrien@Rand-Unix.ARPA (Michael_OBrien)	Thanks very much for your input.

Passing the FULLNAME if it is a LITATOM and otherwise the stream might be reasonable, although adhoc. Passing the stream, and fixing NORMALCOMMENTSFLG is possibly acceptable.

When copying a file from one partition to the other (using Copyfile or Copybytes), the Sysdir of the other partition is getting mangled causing the next operation to that partition to break with a "hard disk error". Running scavenge fixes it some of the time - other times, we've had to erase the disk and start from scratch to fix the problem. We've been using copyfile and copybytes on another 1100 without any problems, so I suspect that we have a hardware problem.

Richard: suggest putting a (\CLOCK0 \CARETFLASHTIME) into the display device's afterxxx eventfn.This is a general problem, that timers do not always "expire" over logout.  The process code assures that any process waiting on a timer does wake up after logout, but privately maintained timers escape this.  The problem is worst on the Dandelion, whose millisecond timer starts out at zero when you boot Lisp.  The Dolphin and Dorado currently inherit the Alto's millisecond timer, which is not zeroed at startup, and which generally increases along with the date.  However, if you logged out on a Dolphin and came back 25 days later to resume that memory image, you'd observe the same caret lossage, I believe.  Might even be true if you booted a sysout 25 days after it was made.	Bill*start*00566 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 Mar 84 15:34 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Lisp: FLOPPY loses space in FILE RESOURCES EXCEEDEDTo: LispSupport.pacc: masinter.paLisp-System-Date:  1-Mar-84 14:24:22Machine-Type: DandelionIf in the course of writing files on a floppy you get FILE  SYSTEM RESOURCES EXCEED, and you abort out of it, the file is closed, does not appear in the directory, but the space isn't there either.I would think that the file should be inserted in the directory at OPEN time, not close, no?*start*02407 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 Mar 84 16:00 PSTSender: Dering.pasaSubject:   New Floppy FunctionsTo: Roach.paFrom: Deringcc:1100Support,LispSupport.PA,DeringSystem: FEB-25 Sysout------------------------Kelly,I have been assigned the task of preparing documentation on FLOPPY device for distribution to customer sites.  I  would appreciate your help with the following questions.1.  Are FLOPPY.LENGTHS and FLOPPY.ALLOCATIONS intended to be user functions?  If so, shouldn't we document what they return?  Also, these functions do not appear to notice if  the floppy  door has been opened since their last call.2.  (FLOPPY.WAIT.FOR FLOPPY T)  also does not "notice"  the floppy door has been opened.  If you call this function, change the floppy, and do DIR {FLOPPY}*  the directory of the previous floppy is returned.  If you open and close the floppy drive door and the do DIR the correct directory listing will be returned.3.  (FLOPPY.CAN.READP) returns T if there is a floppy in the drive;  (FLOPPY.WAIT.FOR.FLOPPY) returns NIL.  The documentation implies they are equivalent.4.  I have been unable to use FLOPPY.SCAVENGE to restore files that have been deleted from the floppy.  The problem is manifested in two forms.  On a floppy on which formatting and copying of files was done in Mesa,  (FLOPPY.SCAVENGE) breaks with the message "NIL - ARG NOT LIST" (LISTPUT BROKEN) .  The arguments to LISTPUT have the following values:  LST=nil  PROP=version VAL=nil.  After the unsuccessful scavenge any operation on the floppy results in the error (LISTPUT BROKEN).(FLOPPY.SCAVENGE) on a floppy created entirely in the 25-FEB sysout did not break.  The deleted file was restored and could be loaded.  However,  no additional files could be written  on the floppy.  A  DIR listed a new file ?0001 and FLOPPY.LENGTHS  showed a file of 1936 pages.5.  Finally could you clarify the documentation on (FLOPPY.RESTART), in particular what is meant by  "A last resort way to try to restart {FLOPPY] if you think {FLOPPY} IS smashed."  Does this mean the user should execute this function if he thin the code that support the {FLOPPY} device has been damaged somehow, e.g. some global variable has been unintentionall redefined?  Why should you try opening and closing the floppy drive door first?  Thanks for any help you can provide.Judy   *start*00518 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 Mar 84 15:29 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: edit mark character - annoyanceIn-reply-to: Burton.pa's message of 7 Mar 84 16:04 PSTTo: Burton.pa, Kaplancc: LafiteSupport.paI tend to agree that the cursor is a lousy one.

I note that there are quite a few AR's marked fixed, attn release, for which the fix is not yet on <LispCore>.  Specifically, scads of tedit bugs.  Is this the correct status?

(1) The ringbells "feature" in PROMPTFORWORD only is active while PROMPTFORWORD has the tty.  Personally, I would say this is not the problem, since I think the ringbells hack in PROMPTFORWORD is of dubious worth, and often an annoyance.

The first step was the removal of the source code from the system on the grounds of space.  The second step was the removal of the source *pointers* from the system on the same grounds.  This made it effectively impossible even for knowledgeable users to explore the system, without incurring an inordinate wait for loading FNS/VARS.  The third step was the de-supporting of the external data base which could have substituted for the time-consuming FNS/VARS mechanism.  The next step was the decision not to even distribute sources to Interlisp-D customers, which makes it impossible for XSIS to offload any of their support work and cripples Xerox' ability to benefit from work by customers at the system level.  The most recent step is the institution of the AR mechanism, which drastically decreases the ability of users to find out anything about the fate of bug reports or feature requests by interposing a queue of unknown (and unknowable) delay, priority mechanism, etc., not to mention the psychological "black hole" effect which I have seen operate in the Mesa world.As each of these steps has occurred, I have felt less and less interested in continuing to work in the Interlisp world.  I find the AR mechanism particularly objectionable: I submitted a bug report for something that would obviously take someone less than 10 minutes to find and fix, and got back the message "This problem has been assigned AR # 521 in the LispSupport action request database".  I would rather have waited 3 or 4 days for the fix than gotten a message the next day telling me nothing and giving me the impression that my bug report had been stuffed in some huge anonymous file somewhere from which it might, maybe, be retrieved someday.It should be noted that I use Lisp only on Maxc from a terminal at home.

The WHEREIS package also works from Maxc. I guess this is the 'external database'. It has not been de-supported; in fact, it recently was added to the packages we support from Interlisp-D.I agree that it would be best if we could distribute sources  to customers as long as they are protected by adequate licensing agreements, but I've stopped trying to work taht particular issue. With the licensing of Xerox protocols and release of Pilot sources to universities, it may become easier to do so. Your analysis of the support burden being lessened when sources are released is well taken.About ARs and responsiveness:There are now several hundred users of Interlisp-D. The Interlisp-D system is quite large. The list of things we've already signed up to do is quite large. When we were using electronic mail, and distributing bug reports to everyone, the mail traffic got to be unbearable. There were approximately 6000 messages in 1983. With size of the user community, we can no longer afford the mechanisms that make it possible to respond immediately.

This means that I am never safe in using the middle button, because I don't know where the message is likely to go and I am not told where it went after it went there.I suggest the following change in interaction:  When the middle button is used for Move-to, print out the name of the destination folder in the little prompt window above the browser.  That solves the problem of knowing where to go to retrieve the message.I think I would also not mind it if it requested a mouse confirm after printing out the name of the folder, so I would then get told in advance and have a chance to deny the default move folder, even though I can't see what it is on the screen.  The extra click is a minor inconvenience in return for really being sure about what is going on.In fact, I actually don't see why there is a difference now in the confirmation requirements of the Left and Middle button:  With the Left button, you have to explicitly select the folder, then confirm.  The argument says that you needn't bother confirming on Middle cause its an already known target should apply equally well to a folder that you have just carefully selected.I think there should be confirms on both interactions.*start*00462 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@From: leavitt.guestDate:  5-Apr-84 21:23:52 ESTSubject: Furniture for an 1108To: xerox1100usersgroup^.pacc: leavittI will shortly be receiving an 1108 with a 40MB disk, and I would bemost interested in hearing about any "systems furniture" that anyone has used with such a machine.

This should fix the problem of carets being left on the screen and of windows being created to take the caret out of.  I changed it so that the caret is always visible.  If it is hidden by another window, its window is brought to the top.  I added the function CARETRATE which changes the caret rate of the current process and documented the variable DEFAULTCARETRATE and DEFAULTCARET which change the behavior of the initial caret of the process.  Included below are the changed sections of the manual.This change touched a lot of files so please report any strange behavior.richard{FnDef {Name CARET} {Args NEWCARET}{TextSets the shape that blinks at the location of the next output to the {lisp TTYDISPLAYSTREAM}.  {arg NEWCARET} is either (1) {lisp NIL} - no changes, returns a {lisp CURSOR}{note ptr to CURSORs?} representing the current caret, (2) {lisp OFF} - turns the caret off, (3) a {lisp CURSOR} which gives the new caret shape or (4) {lisp T} - reset the caret to the default which is the value of {VAR DEFAULTCARET}. {index globalvar DEFAULTCARET}  {VAR DEFAULTCARET} can be set to change the initial caret for new processes.  The hotspot of {arg NEWCARET} indicates which point in the new caret bitmap should be located at the current output position.  The previous caret is returned.Note: the bitmap for the caret is not limited to the dimensions {var CURSORWIDTH} by {var CURSORHEIGHT}.}}{FnDef {Name CARETRATE} {Args NMILLISECONDS}{TextSets the rate at which the caret for the current process will flash.

We first describe a  decoupled architecturebased on the CRAY-1 scalar architecture. Then, we compare its performance with the CRAY-1 and with an implementation of the CRAY-1 based on Tomasulo's algorithm which uses extensive taggingand result forwarding in order to achieve dynamic instruction scheduling. Next, the sensitivity to memory access delays is studied by varying memory access time over a wide range of values.Finally, we study queue lengths in decoupled machines, and show the effect of queue lengths on performance. Relatively short queues are shown to give optimum, or near optimum, performance.----------------In summer of 1982 Shlomo Weiss was a summer intern with KSA (then the VLSI Systems Design Area).  During the summer he developed an interactive program for simulating and displaying digital circuits represented in terms of combinational logic and clocks.  Unanimous consensus of the group was that he is a very bright fellow.Shlomo's interests range from digital architectures to computer-aided design to expert systems.  He is a potential candidate for positions in any of the three laboratories in computer research at PARC.Shlomo will be here for 2 days to allow time for interviewing.  Interested persons should contact Mimi Gardner to get in the schedule.                    <       TIMESROMAN                           <       TIMESROMAN                           <       TIMESROMAN                           <    b   TIMESROMAN                           <    )   TIMESROMAN                           <       TIMESROMAN                           <       TIMESROMAN                           <        TIMESROMAN                           <       TIMESROMAN                           <       TIMESROMAN                           <   o   TIMESROMAN           | z7------------------------------------------------------------     ----- End Forwarded Messages -----------------------------------*start*00445 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  6 Apr 84 11:00 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: TEdit format messages: yuchh!In-reply-to: Putz.pa's message of Fri, 6 Apr 84 10:23:56 PSTTo: Putz.pacc: TEditSupport, LafiteSupport.pa, MessageSystemImplementors^.paWe quite agree.

When bug reports were being handled informally, I felt I had reasonable assurance that someone with the competence to evaluate and repair the bug would look at it within a few days: with the AR system, it feels as though new procedural barriers have been interposed, with the effect that it may be a long time before anyone competent even sees the problem, and the old feeling of a personal contract with the system maintainers has to be replaced by an impersonal (and explicit) contract with the support organization.*start*00172 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  6 Apr 84 11:45 PSTFrom: Burton.paSubject: Lisp: ar #511 has been fixedTo: LispSupport.pa*start*00185 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  6 Apr 84 11:56 PSTFrom: Burton.paSubject: ar# 522To: Lispsupportcc: le.pasafixed.

There are two pressing problems, both of which are being submitted as AR's.1.  0915 abort when installing Lisp from VAX.  The problem is either in Jerry Fungs Install Tool or in DEI version 6.  Jerry and Phil are investigating this.  In the meantime, Teknowledge will try using a potentially unreliable workaround to recover from the 0915.2.  9016 and 9318 Raid calls.  Teknowledge claims that at least once per day per 1108, Lisp aborts with 9016 or 9318 MP codes.  Teknowledge staff still prefer to timeshare on the 2060 rather than risk losing work on the 1108.  Because of  (1) above, I was unable to  find a way to reproduce these problems for Bill van Melle.

This is implemented by a timer in its input character routine.  This routine, being a good citizen, calls \TTYBACKGROUND while it is idle, which has the side effect of blocking (until next bugged) if you take the tty process away from PROMPTFORWORD.(1) I hate this feature.  My understanding of why this feature is in there is because of calls to PROMPTFORWORD in the Promptwindow, which often go unnoticed.  [Side note: submit ar "Flush RINGBELLS from PROMPTFORWORD (or make it optional)"].(2) But given this feature, its behavior in your case is probably correct.  If you are typing at window x and suddenly the machine starts ringing a bell at you because you haven't typed in window y, what are you supposed to make of it?  Flashing the window where the prompting is going on would make much more sense.(3) For this particular problem, the correct solution I think is for Tedit to do its prompting in or near its own window.  John says he is adding a promptwindow to Tedit (like Lafite), so this may already be done.*start*00726 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Sender: Sannella.PADate:  6 Apr 84 11:56:05 PST (Friday)Subject: Re: AR: 65 Fix MAKELISPFLOPPIES.DOC _ BrokenIn-reply-to: Masinter's message of 5 Apr 84 17:22 PSTTo: Masintercc: JFung.pasa, LispSupportFrom: LispSupport.pa1) I have moved [phylum]<Lisp>Current>MakeLispFloppies.DOC to <lispcore>next>.2) In general, nobody but I should put anything on [phylum]<lisp>3) AR 65 started when it seemed that there was a problem with the InstillationUtility.

In fact, I often wish this were true for user records as well; in most cases I have seen, the additional fields are just synonyms or alternative perspectives on the main record, and I find it confusing and/or annoying to find them in the inspect window.

Remaining in this DownButtonstate until I leave A, if I			i)  ButtonUp in the Background, A's CURSOROUTFN is triggered *on the Upstroke* and not when I exit the window.  			ii) ButtonUp in window B, A's CURSOROUTFN is triggered, along with B's CURSORINFN *on the Upstroke while in B*.  In this case, B's EVENTBUTTONFN is not triggered (consistent with the belief of allowing an easy no-op option for A, I guess, although the button originally went down in the Background and not in A).		b)  Similarly, If I enter A with ButtonUp, then ButtonDown while in A and move outside A with Button still Down, (i) and (ii) also hold.	The above implies 1)  that WHEN a window's CURSORINFN/CURSOROUTFN is triggered is dependent on the mousestate, and not always when the window is actually entered/exited, and 2)  after ButtonDowning in the Background, the first window I glide over while Down is essentially selected and committed for that stroke.	2)  Tracking the mouse with BUTTONEVENTFNs and setting global variables or FLGing via windowprops or whatever to bypass the window handler and consequences due to (1) doesn't really help because, not being able to tell when the CURSORfns will trigger, you don't know where you are (unless you write your own mini-windowhandler).	Suggestion:	Simply, I think the CURSOR...FNs should trigger independent of the Buttonstate of the mouse.   This would allow us to provide feedback to the user for what window the cursor is currently over, regardless of whether the buttons are up or down or how they got that way.   In particular, I should be able to UN-highlight a window when the cursor slides out because after that point (until it slides back in) a no-op will be performed, i.e., the window is UN-selected.  Similarly, I should be able to highlight the current window, independent of where I came from and in what Buttonstate.	I DO agree that BUTTONEVENTFNs should not trigger for any window anywhere outside the window in which the button went down.  This form of the no-op option appears to be the best and should stay.	Thus, my suggestion is to give programmers more control once a BUTTONEVENTFN is triggered, let them worry about the CURSOR...FNs side effects as the cursor slides all around the place, but do stop short of changing the feature mentioned in the previous paragraph.  	Is this possible?  I realize that if this change were made it may cause grief for a lot of existing code.Danp.s.  Menus....  My assumption (as I don't know) is that those aren't little windows at all but boxed items highlighted by an ItemHandler a la WindowHandler under the menu's BUTTONEVENTFN. *start*00521 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  6 Apr 84 23:17 PSTFrom: Halvorsen.paSubject: TEdit: Para looks disappear with scrollingTo: TEditSupport.pacc: Halvorsen.paTEdit System Date:  6-Apr-84 16:45:56Lisp System Date:  6-Apr-84 18:33:24Machine: Dandelion (Halvorsen)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 17777Frequency:  Sometimes Impact:  SeriousWhen you set the margins on a paragraph to  anything but the default full width lines overflow on the left and on the right.*start*00418 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  7 Apr 84 15:13 PSTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Lafite: Wish:  A Find command in the message displayerTo: LafiteSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 28-Feb-84 13:10:33Lisp-System-Date: 13-Mar-84 10:21:31Machine-Type: DoradoI'd like to be able to find things in the messages that I'm reading without having to scroll and search with my eyeballs.*start*01373 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  7 APR 84 15:14 PSTFrom: MASINTER.PASubject: AR filebworserTo:   lispsupportcc:   JELLINEK0jPlease mark all AR's on FileBrowser attn: Jellinek.

Thus, ILEQ is not reasonable, but 0<ntypx<alpha might be. However, given statistical frequency, a DISPATCH might be just as well, with 3 opcodes:FIXP, NUMBERP, LITATOM.Actually, we have proposed in the past a combination opcode which does the test and a conditional jump:JFIXP, JNFIXP, JNUMBERP, JNNUMBERP, JLITATOM, JNLITATOM.There is some (complex) logic in the compiler available already which will compile the unusual cases where the predicate is NOT used merely to determine a branch, or when a long branch is needed. I believe with the advent of BIGNUMs that we will absolutely want bignums to satisfy FIXP and NUMBERP, and that indeeed we will want rationals to be NUMBERP. Thus, there is another argument which says that the determination of these predicates should not be made by a numerical comparison of the type number, but rather by a bit test in the DTD, which would give us the opportunity to make odd sub-classes of these datatypes.[JonL: I'm cc:ing you for your comments; please feel free to add them to this AR. Since this is a Difficulty HARD requiring work on all three microcodes and the compiler, and an impact MINOR or MODERATE, and there are some open design issues, I think we should make sure we've resolved all of the open design questions before pressing ahead with implementation.]Date: 11 Jan 84 02:43 PSTFrom: JonL.paSubject: New suggestion. And cold data to douse hot conjectureTo: Masintercc: vanMelle, Charnley, Purcell, JonL, BLISPRe: your message of 6 JAN 84 17:12 PSTBased on some observations while re-running a few of the dorado benchmarks, I suggest adding a new opcode which is like TYPEP, except that it checks for type number ILEQ rather than EQ to the data byte; reasoning follows below.Interestingly, while re-running these benchmarks, I uncoveredseveral items which should put to rest the conjectures that LITATOM isn't statistically important, and that adding a microinstruction to the TYPEP opcode would result in a net loss.  In the commentary below, "system" means SYSFILES on FULL.SYSOUTplus another dozen or so of my favorite <Lisp>Library> files.1) Masterscope shows 357 system callers of LITATOM -- almost   double the number of all the other TYPEP generators combined   (excepting one, which I'll discuss in 2 below).  The others,    and their "weights", with some overlap, are STRINGP(112),    FLOATP(30), SMALLP(83), STACKP(20), and ARRAYP(40);  FIXP    doesn't figure in here since it is a union of types, and    no place gives rise to a bare TYPEP(\FIXP) call.   If the    performance of LITATOM isn't important, then maybe that of    the others isn't either?   More to the point, if LITATOM were to use TYPEP, then        *** regardless of whether the 100% to 200% speedup were   ever statisticaly observable *** the fact that two bytes   would be saved on each usage would free up at least a page   and a half of system space, and probably more.2) LISTP (opcode) generators are often "hidden", in that the   MAP series open-code using it, and many iterative statements   would also.  There must be thousands of places in the system   where LISTP is used.  So I decided to run some benchmarks to   see ** how much ** the extra microinstruction really cost.   Most of Gabriel's "list intensive" benchmarks don't even    generate any usages of TYPEP (or LISTP) -- many use ATOM   which generates NTYPX;  but BOYER does (via NLISTP) -- and     it calls EQUAL which also does -- all in central rather    than in peripheral parts of the program.  So I ran BOYER 6     times in each flavor of microcode, and came up with a    ***** 0%  difference *****   Actual data, hand-recorded in my lab notebook are also   reproduced below.  For a second set of comparisons, I   put the file <Lisp>Library>BSEARCH on my local disk, and   did 5 runs of (LOAD '{DSK}BSEARCH 'PROP), and then 3 runs of   (MAKEFILE '{DSK}BSEARCH 'NEW)in each flavor of microcode.   The result?   ***** 0%  difference *****   These results sound so incredible, that I just had to run   *something* that would show the difference.  A tightest-   possible loop, cdring down a length-1000 list 10,000 times,   indeed showed the differential:  without the extra micro-   instruction, it was 2815.5 nanoseconds per loop, and with   the extra one, it was 2879.3 nanoseconds; happily, this   difference is effectively 64 nanoseconds (which, by the   way, is only a 2% difference -- practically, the largest    measurable for this change).Of course, this "0%" is a statistical figure, which just means that any differences were below the "noise" in measuring.Still, one could hardly have a more clear-cut decision aboutthe advisibility of supporting LITATOM with the TYPEP opcode.If one is still uncertain, then the implementation of theLISTP opcode could be differentiated from that of the TYPEP opcode (maybe they are already on the other machines?? it just happened to be convenient on the Dorado for them to be exactly the same micro routine).A final comment.  Until now, I didn't really realize howbadly FIXP compiles -- 9 bytes instead of 1 or 2.  NUMBERP iseven worse!

The definition of "simultaneously" is within the interval defined by MOUSECHORDWAIT, below.  Middle is considered to be down until BOTH Left and Right come up.If you need to do a mouse operation that would require Middle plus some other button down, you can free one (but never both) of the buttons by letting up on it while still holding the other one down.  The logical state of the mouse is still considered Middle, but the freed button is now available to register up or down independently.  For example, on a 3-button mouse if you are reshaping a window using Middle and want to switch corners, you press Right while still holding down Middle, move to the desired corner, and then let up on Right.  To do the same thing on a 2-button mouse, after pressing Left+Right to get Middle, you let up on Right while still holding Left.  This "frees" Right from the chord, and you can now press down on Right, move to the other corner, let up on Right, all the while still holding Left.  (This is probably easier to do than describe.)To get the combination Left + Right, just don't press them down at the same instant.  To get Left + Middle + Right, or to get combinations in which Middle is not the first (logical) button to go down, you must still resort to the use of the Center key on the keyboard.  (I don't know any operations that require such a combination.)The Center key continues to be a synonym for Middle mouse, independent of the above.(MOUSECHORDWAIT msecs)		[Function]Specifies the interval of time (in milliseconds) during which the Left and Right buttons on a DLion mouse must go down to be considered "simultaneous" and hence treated as Middle.  Returns the previous setting.  (MOUSECHORDWAIT) returns the current setting without changing it.  (MOUSECHORDWAIT NIL) disables chording.  The largest permissible setting is 1872 milliseconds, or almost 2 seconds.The system is conservatively initialized with (MOUSECHORDWAIT 50).  You may want to set it higher; I suspect 100 or even 200 might be acceptable.  The competing constraints: The lower the setting, the more difficult it is to chord (the more coordinated your fingers must be).  The higher the setting, the longer the system must wait when you press down Left or Right alone before deciding that it's not going to turn into Middle; hence, the less responsive the mouse might seem in such cases.  If there is some concensus among Dandelion users regarding the optimal setting, we could make that the default before this system gets released.	Bill*start*00368 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 08:42 PSTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Re: Dandelion phantom middle mouse buttonIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 8 Apr 84 22:29 PSTTo: vanMelle.pa, LispSupport.paBill:Thanks greatly for getting onto this so fast.BeauMike:There is an AR Wish for this somewhere.Beau*start*00451 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 Apr 84 22:56 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lisp: forDuration compiles using \FIXP freeTo: LispSupport.pacc: vanMelle.paLisp System Date:  8-Apr-84 18:02:02Machine: Dandelion (Big-Chip)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 5777Impact: MinorforDuration compiles a (\CREATECELL \FIXP), which is a free ref to the variable \FIXP if you don't have ABC loaded.	Bill*start*00475 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 APR 84 20:34 PSTFrom: JONL.PASubject: Re: Lisp: forDuration compiles using \FIXP freeTo:   vanMelle, LispSupportcc:   JONLIn response to the message sent   8 Apr 84 22:56 PST from vanMelle.paThis is a bug in NCREATE rather than in DURATION.The AR is:  (NCREATE 'FIXP) macroexpands into (CREATECELL \FIXP) and \FIXP            hasn't been declared GLOBALVARS in the installed sysout.*start*00625 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 Apr 84 23:31 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: TEdit: Scrolling Tedit window leaves caret droppingsTo: TEditSupport.pacc: Burton, vanMelle.paTEdit System Date:  6-Apr-84 16:45:56Lisp System Date:  7-Apr-84 20:16:56Machine: Dorado (Archimedes)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 10000Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingI have noticed a number of caret droppings on my Tedit windows, that seem to arise when scrolling, but not very reliably.

You say "it would seem much safer if you could mark the resource once, rather than mark each piece of code that uses it".  True, but "uses it" is a little vague.  You need to require that all accesses to it go through some stylized construct that enforces the monitor.  No reason you can't hide that with macros or accessfns, of course.  But this turns out to be pretty much equivalent to "you have to wrap each piece of code which uses the global resource in a with.monitor".  And the with.monitor around the entire chunk of code is probably going to be a lot more efficient than putting one on each access.Another comment is that protecting a shared resource typically involves more than just the explicit accesses to a data structure.	Bill*start*00915 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 14:37 PSTFrom: jordan.paSubject: Re: AR 368: Cannot BREAK S-expr from inside DEditIn-reply-to: Sheil.pa's message of 8 Apr 84 15:28 PSTTo: Sheil.pacc: jordan.pa, LispSupport.paBeau,	I found the bug I reported to be pretty strange and was not clear on exactly what info to report, as the function was involved in a Dedit/Break tangle, and I also was not able to immediately reproduce it.

The next time the file is accessed from Lisp, it is seen in the wrong mode."The report puzzled me, so I called Bill White for clarification.  Something apparently got lost in translation.  The real problem is:The Library files distributed by Floppy have no file type.   When you COPYFILE such a file to another place, such as their Vax or their 20, the file is written as type TEXT (the default), which is wrong for dcom files, and loses information in the case of writing the file on the 20.Thus, there are potentially two problems here:(1) Files on the Library floppies have no TYPE attribute.  This is either attn Roach, if the problem is that Floppy doesn't support or recognize the TYPE attribute, or else attn 1100Support for the way it is creating floppies for distribution.(2) COPYFILE, when the source file has no TYPE, should infer the type.  This has been on my task list for a while now.	Bill*start*00401 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 18:25 PSTFrom: Wallace.paSubject: Lisp: Reporting bugsTo: LispSupport.pacc: LafiteSupportLisp System Date:  8-Apr-84 18:02:02Machine: Dorado (Ventana)Microcode version: 24,2Memory size: 10000Impact: Minor There ought to be a break package command that inserts a stack backtrace into a bug report form.*start*00361 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 19:04 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: [Kaplan.pa: AR 340:  OUTFILEP returning NIL for CORE ]In-reply-to: Jellinek.pa's message of 9 Apr 84 09:58 PSTTo: kaplan, jellinek, lispsupportcc: Masinter.paChange AR to read OUTFILEP({CORE}file;1) always fails; status OPEN.*start*00678 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 19:06 PSTFrom: JonL.paSubject: Lisp: INTERRUPTCHAR's HARDFLG interacts badly with ??To: LispSupport.pacc: JonL.paLisp-System-Date:  4-Apr-84 15:14:33Machine-Type: DolphinTry(INTERRUPTCHAR (CHARCODE ^T) '(CONTROL~T~AND~MORE) T)where CONTROL~T~AND~MORE just dribbles some information out to the T stream (using DSPSOUT) and then calls the CONTROL-T function.there seems to be random stuff in the keyboard input buffer upon occasion after typing a ^T; furthermore, typing a <CR> after ^T seems to cause something from one of the previous lines to be inserted.

John Sybalsky,who is developing TEdit, has made some strides forward, and David Wallacehas resurrected Kelly Roach's library package called EMACS (hooking intothe programmable interface of TEdit to provide guess-what-kind-of userinterface).First, some trivial things:T1) you can search for a string containing just about any character you   want (modulo interruptchars, which TEdit seems to turn off anyway) just   by "escaping" the character with ^V in the string;  this particularly   applies to ? and to CRT2) I like the idea of the font-selection menu having each menu item print   out in the font designated by its name.  MENUs indeed can have a bitmap   for an item (or for the CAR of an item) so it wouldn't mean having all   the font "in core" just to create this menu.Second, I'd like to add my support to your suggestion for certain functionalitywhich I'll just call "Serious Lacunae"SL1) TEdit is far too "mouse bound".  this shows up no only in the lack of   cursor-motion and scrolling keys, but also in the large number of user   hand motions necessary for search, move, and copy commands (see next two   points).SL2) Searching is overly cumbersome to initiate; it begins at an obscure   place in the file, and often doesn't provide enough of a "standout" at   the point whereat the item was found.  Some time ago I suggested an EMACS-   like incremental search for TEdit, but if the <Lisp>Library> package to   support EMACS style isn't overly-confining, maybe that will be satisfactory   by itself;  I don't know about too many other editors, but EMACS doesn't   start its searching from "the beginning of what is visible in the window"   and although I appreciate the problem  (especially when the caret is in   some obscure place) I don't think you can dispense with exact-position   for the start place;  I too would rather see the "found place" centered   on the window rather than placed at the top (like BRAVO does).SL3) There is no easy way to mark your place in the file and come back to   it.  EMACS has the concept of a ring-buffer (eight long) of marked places,   which is very useful, and TECO of course has "variables".  Would it be so   hard to implement "variables" for TEDIT, which remembered file spots?SL4) Undo should be like teh LISP editor to be really useful.  Yes, and double   yes!  I too have often been hit by inadvertent nudgings of the undo key   (while reaching for BS key) and discovered it only after typing something   else, thereby losing all my work.All in all, your memo was very thoughtful, and I for one appreciate yourtaking the time to record all these things in an orderly fashion.  - JonL -*start*00912 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  3 APR 84 16:21 PSTFrom: ROACH.PASubject: Brian Smith comments concerning TEDITTo:   LISPSUPPORTcc:   ROACH     Comments from Brian Smith to Emacssupport^ relevant to Tedit:    (1) "Tabs are set to 5 (i.e., at columns 1, 6, 11, etc.)  Is thiscontrollable?"

Walnut currently has several annoying "features" and some major deficiencies.  She discussed how they intend to solve the current problems, including hiding transaction aborts at the lowest level, retrieving new mail in parallel rather than as a single transaction, finding ways to deal with the proliferation of message set buttons, finding better ways to display large message sets, and adding a full programming interface.  There was a "mailing" discussion (the successor to "printing" discussions) for suggestions for enhancements and features.Jim Donahue discussed the current state and future plans for Cypress and Squirrel.  Cypress is an entity/relation model database system, and Squirrel is a browser/editor for Cypress data bases.  The main lessons they learned about how database applications should be structured and about how Cypress should change are: transactions are painful, especially in handling aborts gracefully; contrary to most of the data base literature, the user wants many data bases; and Cypress type checking is too expensive, especially for primitive types.  To address these, they plan to cache schemata over a closed transaction, redo the DBStorage level, speed up type checking, and build a Cypress server.*start*00522 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  4 Apr 84 19:33 PSTFrom: Wallace.paSubject: Lisp: Resetting interruptsTo: LispSupport.paLisp-System-Date:  1-Mar-84 14:24:22Machine-Type: DoradoI set keyboard interrupts in my EMACS process which are different from the default ones.

If we had a program that would read Intepress files, and from that, generate a Lisp program which actually created that file, we could proceed toward some pretty interesting and general utilities; e.g., we could take the diagrams tht were generated by Star and move them back into a paramaterizable and editable format. I suggestthis as an AR rather than an idea for, say, Ken Feueurman, because I think that there are probably some capabilities that are needed in the intepress generation code that aren't there. In fact, it would be best if the interpress reader generated DIG code, e.g., so that you could then run the program on the display. (It is almost necessary to do that if you are going to display an interpress document in a window smaller than the document.)-------------------------------------System:kernelSubsystem:compilerImpact:moderateProblem type:performancePriority:perhapsDifficulty:moderateSubject:debug compiler optimizations with stack relative instructionsAttn: charnley, vanMelle, JonL, MasinterDescription: This AR is in two parts. One part is to write microcode forCOPY.N and STORE.N two-byte opcodes for doing stack relative addressing.I suggest that in addition to COPY (= COPYN 0) we have COPY1, COPY2, andthen a (hard, slower COPY.N two byte). This design is partly because there is a much bigger difference on the Dolphin, but pprobably it will also make a difference on DLion. Now, what to do with this? Well, there is already built into the compiler a large suite of optimizations based around stack relative addressing, including duplicate sub-expression elimination, and getting rid of extra frames where all args are local, etc. I think that the nextround of compiler wizardry will rely on the ability to address more thanthe top of stack.-------------------------------------System:environmentSubsystem:file packageImpact:moderateProblem type:bug/wishPriority:HopefullyDifficulty:ModerateSubject:rationalize file package information about file locationDescription:Currently, the internal representation of where the 'external' source of a file is is pretty ad-hoc. For example, when you LOAD a file, it pays attention to the filename in the FILECREATED expression. In fact, this turns out to be a non feature in environments like Interlisp-D where users tend to move files from one place to another quite frequently.I think the right way of handling this is to remove the pretense that the system can keep track of where the file was originally made as a meaningful concept. Rather, it should only pay attention to where it FOUND the file. To ensure that this is adhered to, we would change the file name in FILECREATED to be the generic (internal) file name rather than the external name. Secondly, we would make LOAD and LOADFROM etc. explicitly store in some kind of a-list database the correspondence between internal external etc. files. (This is an off the cuff design but it is the simplest.) For example, one list might be just a list of 'load events': (internalname externalname filetype loadtype time) in reverse order of occurrence. Then we would ensure that those packages which were looking up some information about a file would just look it up in the 'load event' database with the appropriate functional interface. This would simplify a lot of internal hackery in the file package, and also allow us to rationalize what happens when you make a file on the floppy, copy it to disk, compile it on the disk, move both to the file server, etc. It would mean tht files wouldn't have {phylum} built in and the system wouldn't be looking for it all the time. We could remove the hack from FINDFILE and every place that was looking at the FILEDATE property.If, for performance reasons, the A-list becomes to onerous, we could build a cache. This discussion belongs in the one about 'moving files' that somebody submitted.-------------------------------------System:OSSubsystem:generic fileImpact:moderateProblem type:wishPriority:PerhapsDifficulty:hardSubject:want remote dialin, chat server, etc. capabilities from dumb terminalsDescription:This AR covers a number of similar tasks which should be done in parallel to avoid duplication. The general idea is to be able totalk to Interlisp-D from a remote terminal. There are as many instances of remote terminals as there of CHATs going out: RS232, Ttyport, Chat, NS Telnet, and eventually TCP/IP telnet. This job is done in a couple ofdifferent steps:a) make sure that Interlisp-D can still run with window package either turned off or not loaded. This means making sure that all of the places that assume windows in fact have conditional code that tests if the window system is on. Secondly, need some way of changing the keyboard stream from {KEY} to one of the other bisync streams. It probably means rewriting the low level keyboard driver to go thru the stream interface. The next hard problem is making sure that the process that is running the keyboard stream gets frequent cycles, partly because even if there is some low level buffering going on, there needs to be immediate attention to interrupt characters (so the user can control runaway processes).Finally, we need some kind of access protection login mechanism, and a way of limiting the use of the machine (e.g., making everybody login, and if you are logged in, then you can't log in from over the net.)Finally, and much harder, is allowing some kind of distributed terminal controller select one out of a number of machines and give the pretense of a timesharing service from a bank of networked Interlisp-D machines. This is hrder because there is no way of booting the machine over the network, and the personal machine doesn't have the crash recovery properties that you need for remote access of unattended machines to work.-------------------------------------System:textSubsystem:teditImpact:moderateProblem type:wishPriority:perhapsDifficulty:moderateSubject:support CSLI EMACS interface to TEditDescription: CSLI is doing their EMacs interface and developing it, but in order for Xerox to distribute it, we may need to support it.

At least on the Dorado, it would free up substantial amounts of microcode space if we could get rid of the remaining needs.   we could either retain the current bootstrap/with/BCPL or convert over to a new boot regime (which would allow faster startup on Dorado, a real pain now toswap in your workingset. I think the main tasks are to move the thernet controller from BCPL into Lisp (which may solve some of the performance problems and also some bugs with the Dorado ethernet controller) and to move the disk controller into Lisp (maybe itis there already). Can you fill this AR out some more, Bill?--------------------------------------System:languageSubsystem:arithmeticImpact:moderateProblem type:wishPriority:perhapsDifficulty:hardSubject:want bignumsDescription:this is a desire for a smoothly integrated BIGNUM package in Interlisp-D.Smooth integration means that it fits well into the current way of Interlisp-D doing arithmetic. Interlisp puts few if any constraints on the way arithmetic is done or the word size (since we have both 32 and 36 bit implementations witha variety of SMALLP ranges). However, the current Interlisp-D implementation inplaces confuses INTEGER (arbitrary precision) with 32-bit arithmetic. Thus, oneof the preconditions may require running with OVERFLOW(T) and weeding out thoseplaces tht are relying on implicit arithmetic modulus. Design A: 16-bit smalls, 32-bit mediums, arbitrary bignums.All numbers are NUMBERP and FIXP (must change macro for FIXP, NUMBERP or maybe new opcode or bit in DTD). All arithmetic operations PLUS, TIMES, IPLUS, ITIMES etc work on bigs. TYPENAME is the proper way to distinguish between the three datatypes tht distinguished numbers. This involves minor changes to microcode, but massive rewrite of tha arithmetic UFNs, with some care exhibited. At the same time, we can add rational arithmetic. Rationals are NUMBERP not FIXP not FLOATP. Design B is just to get rid of the intermediate 32-bit quanta. This is probablyundesirable only because of the number of places in the system that use 32-bit boxes for things like clocks and timers.It is imperative that "FIXP" be retained as a generic "INTEGERP".It is reasonable when adding bignums to also add positive infinity and negativeinfinity. These special quantities which are also FIXP are the value of MAX.FIXP and MIN.FIXP.JonL has had a confusion between Interlisp FIXP and MacLisp FIXNUM and introduced some distinctions between FIXP and INTEGER. While MACLISP made that cut, it would be more reasonable for backward compatibility to say that ALL integers are FIXP.This distinction probably will need to be elaborated in the manual.--------------------------------------System:environmentSubsystem:editorImpact:moderateProblem type:performancePriority:perhapsDifficulty:moderateSubject:Reduce workingset of programming enviornment loopDescription:I assigned this to "editor" but it fits in with a number of other applications. As Gordon Novak reported quite a while ago, the memory requirements of the Interlisp-D read/edit/debug/etc. look are very very high. It was unreasonably high. One of the major complaints about the "unusable" performance on the 1100 and 1108 with 1.5 MByte was exactly that the environment workingset was too big. Now, ano matter how much memory you add, this is an issue because once you've run an application, your enviornment gets paged out, and the time to page it in is proportional to its workingset--- morememory won't help in the long run, unless the calculation and the editor all fit into the memory of the machine. Now, what to do? The first thing is to run with RELEASEWORKINGSET and COREHAX thru the loop of doing a LOADFROM of a program, editing it using DEDIT, running it, hitting a breakpoint, showing the stack, etc. and look and see what gets swapped in, using COREHAX and possibly some better tools developed for this purpose.

We need at least a document and preferably a PROGRAM which automates the processes that happen when doing a variety of tasks for LispSupport. (Perhaps document with major procedures embodied in programs.) For example, I would like to retain thewish that LispSupport take charge of updating the release directories on [Rose], [Idun], [Ivan], [Aztec], and a number of other file servers which purport to hold the Interlisp-D release but in fact have old or out of date copies. Perhaps this is a job for Pasadena?

I think that the Star or XDE design is just fine for most of them. In particular, using Larger/Smaller to change font size,using Font to pop up a menu of choices (maybe with some chance of typing in a new font name in a pop-up prompt window), using Superscript/Subscript (may require moving lock/unlock elsewhere), using "Next" to hit next fillin slot, and shift-Next to hit previous one, using the "Find" button to invoke Find, etc. These interface engineering tasks are imperative for the acceptance of TEdit, even though they don't affect the 'engine' underneath. The lack of thesekinds of features is probably the major motivation for the retrograde movement to the weaker EMacs interface. While we need EMacs for other reasons, we shouldn't let it win for stupid reasons. There've been a variety of complains from users about this.

There appears to be two different types of Installation Utilities, one for PARC and one for XSIS in Pasadena. XSIS's installation utility has some extra options for starting Interlisp directly from the installation utility.Also in testing the Loops standalone sysout for distribution to our customers, I ran into some problems I didn't understand.  The standalone sysout is over 91xx pages long.  On a 10megabyte disk, it appears to run out of Vmem when I try to run Truckin, or so it was suggested to me by some of the folks in Pasadena.  The behavior that it exhibited is as follows: twice I load the sysout from floppies onto a dandelion in the burnin lab, using floppies made at PARC.  Once I used the  installation utility and diagnostics files form PARC and once using the floppies of XSIS. The demo works fine until I get to the Truckin game, were it appears to stop cold, ~30 seconds after starting the game.  This happened two times in a row.  None of the keys worked but the cursor still could be moved around and the cursor kept going back and forth between garbage collecting and a plain cursor.  I am building a new sysout with the latest lisp.sysout from Mike S.  I will make up some floppies tomorrow morning and see if that helps.   It could be that the lisp.sysout that I used earlier had a bug that is now been fixed.Thanks, Mary*start*00767 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  5 Apr 84 23:21 PSTFrom: Wallace.paSubject: Lafite: mail file mungedTo: LafiteSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 28-Feb-84 13:10:33Lisp-System-Date:  1-Mar-84 14:24:22Machine-Type: Dorado{PHYLUM}<WALLACE>ACTIVE.MAIL is damaged in some way that prevents me from expunging old messages, except from the end.Lafite's handling of this is bizarre.

I've got a reply to Woods in the works, filed as <Sybalsky>WoodsReply.TEdit; I think the correct protocol would have been for you to comment on that INTERNALLY.To answer your points:(T2) Well, now, I think you're wrong.  I suppose TEdit could store bitmaps for the stock fonts that appear in the font menu; not so, of course, for "Other" fonts.  I agree that showing the font names in the font would be a nice touch.(SL1) Mouse boundedness is in the eye of the beholder.  I happen to prefer using the mouse to move around; still, reasonable people can differ.  That's why there are the functional interfaces to the various TEdit operations.  I have limited time to spend on things; unless you're volunteering to implement a TEDITKEYS package....(SL2)  Same answer.  If you want an expert "Find" command, write one.  I don't have the time, unless customer demand pushes it upward on the stack.  By the way, have you tried the TEDITMENU package?(SL3)  is answered in my draft answer to Woods.  I claim that what you usually want is several panes on the editing window, so that you can have visible all the places in the file you need to remember.  Marker tokens, I think, are mainly useful in an editor macro language--which is another issue; such a macro facility would be nice (especially if they could be "compiled" to run fast).  Still, it takes user demand to push things up the stack.  Right now, page layout seems to be a bigger item.(SL4)  The problems with UNDO have been accepted as a bug report.  However, I have no plans to support UNDOing operations out of sequence--the problems are just too hairy.-----Date:  5 APR 84 15:21 PSTFrom: JONL.PASubject: Re: TEDIT BUGS ETC.To:   Sybalsky, JONLcc:   Sheil, LispCore^In response to the message sent   4 Apr 84 13:51 PST from Sybalsky.paJohn, it so happens that Bill Woods has been a personal friend of minefor nearly 20 years.

One of my responsibilities as Customer Liaison is to follow up on the disposition of my customers' ARs.  AR370 includes a message directly from you to the customer, with no cc to 1100Support.This could create confusion and does waste time, because the Customer Liaison assigned to Pittsburgh (me) was not aware that you had told her the following:Date: 29 MAR 84 11:22 PSTFrom: ROACH.PASubject: RE: {floppy} errorsTo:   Donna.Auguste@CMU-CS-Acc:   LISPSUPPORT, ROACHHi Donna,     The answers to your questions:     (1) {PHYLUM}<LISP>CURRENT>FLOPPY.TTY.  I've sent you a copy.     (2) A known bug.  This can happen when you ^D during a sysout and{FLOPPY}'s mode doesn't get changed back to PILOT.  Work around: Do(FLOPPY.MODE 'PILOT) when you encounter thise error.     (3) Somehow, you've managed to get a {FLOPPY} STREAM whose PALLOCallocation record is missing from {FLOPPY}'s cached directory.  Idon't believe there should be anything wrong with your floppy, but{FLOPPY}'s info in core is confused.  I'd appreciate more backgroundon this problem if you can repeat it.  Probable workaround is to justopen & close the floppy drive door, which will flush {FLOPPY}'s cacheddirectory structure.     (4) It's up to 1100SUPPORT what source files go out to whichcustomers.  You can get a good idea of what functions are used by{FLOPPY} by doing (APROPOS 'FLOPPY).  I don't have a comprehensiveerror list, but the errors that should happen are generally thestandard file system errors (e.g. "FILE SYSTEM RESOURCES exceeded")which are included in section 9.8 of the Interlisp Reference Manual.				KellyBy the way, I believe  the first sentence of (4) in incorrect information.  Release of source files is an issue being discussed at a MUCH higher level than the 1100Support dl.There have been some messages lately regarding the need for Xerox to have one point of contact for customer.  If you respond  directly to Pittsburgh, without informing us, you will not only get more questions sent directly to you, but confuse the customer as to where to direct queries.Lastly, one of the goals of our group of Customer Liaisons (a part of the 1100Support dl) is that we learn from each of these  answers to bug reports.  That is why you should send your responses to us for redistribution to the customer.Lorraine*start*00341 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  6 Apr 84 10:17 PSTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Re: New version of DEditIn-reply-to: LispSupport.pa's message of 6 Apr 84 08:57 PSTTo: LispSupport.paNO!!!

If I run into it again, I will try to pay more attention to what I had been doing.By the way, what I am doing is writing some tools to help make the Lisp Library and Lispusers floppies we send to customers. The idea is to have all files that depend on one another on the same floppy i.e. BROWSER loads GRAPHER and GRAPHER loads SMALLFONTS, these should all be on the same floppy. Part of what I'm doing is graphing these dependencies as a tree structure as an easy way to see what is going on.Jim     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*01422 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  6 Apr 84 12:19:43 PST (Friday)From: Sannella.PASubject: Questions from ShulmanTo: vanMelle.pacc: Cooper.pa, JFung.pasa, LispSupport.pa----------------------------------------------------------------Received: from RUTGERS.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA;  5 APR 84 18:16:56 PSTDate: 5 Apr 84 21:16:44 ESTFrom: Jeffrey Shulman <SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA>Subject: Need to know a few XNS thingsTo: LispSupport.pacc: SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA, marantz@RUTGERS.ARPA	Roy Marantz has gotten up a preliminary 3Mb to 10MB packet"transmorgifyer" so our DLions can talk to our DEC-20 3Mb Pup basedsoftware (this all runs on an 11/60 running as a gateway between thetwo.)

What XNS does the "Install Lisp Tool" send out before it will	do a PupFtp "install"?  What should we say back to start the	Pup based transfer?		The Install Lisp Tool does not send XNS packets on PupFtp install. When Dlion is power-up, the pilot boot file sends some XNS packets, like CH's BroaadcastForServers (pkt-exchange), CH's Retrieve Item(courier), Time-request/response(pkt-exchange), Router-request(Routing Info) packets.	When you retrieve sysout from NS file server, you will then encounter some XNS packets like:	a.	Open-Connection {SPP system packets, sst=0} Pkt	b.	Series of Filing (Courier) packets (Logon, Open-Directory, Open-Drawer, Open-Folder, Store, followed by proper Closes)		I am not certain whether BulkData Transfer protocol is used in Pilot 10.	c.	I am not sure whether Close-Connection packets (SPP with sst 254, 255) are used.			Is this what they want?	(Im not sure whether I answered to the point)3).	The XNS Time-Request packet is documented in XSIS Misc. Standards.  This may still be Xerox private.

If so, then suspect that thefloppy got written incorrectly, eitherbecause  of a bug in the floppy driver or data corruption on the floppy itself.If that fails in the same way, can you load the same sysout (either via ethernet or floppy) on a 29 Mb disk?One possibility I just thought of: could this be an artifact of the problem that Prometheus doesn't extend the VMEM? Can someone find out (using the EIDisk diagnostic) whether the two machines Mary tried have bad spots on their disks?The problem is that, while Prometheus (installation utility diskette) will install the lisp vmem as a single file, it doesn't extend it to cover the whole volume. Lisp, upon startup, is happy to extend the vmem willy-nilly, without checking for bad pages.Was one of the 'top' or 'bottom' bars of the cursor turned on when the machine froze?*start*00786 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  6 APR 84 21:58 PSTFrom: MASINTER.PASubject: Floppy mode SYSOUTTo:   Roachcc:   LispSupportWe currently have a problem in that the installation utility doesn't make the VMEM file big enough when you install from floppies.One way around that is to mark the file on the floppy as having SIZE of 16000 pages, even though you only store as many pages as you need.I think that is possible to do when writing the file. I'm not explaining this well, but it would fix something that is otherwise a show-stopper.It would mean, however, that people wouldn't ever use Mesa to write sysouts anymore. It would also mean that it would be impossible to use the JFung hack of Install from one volume to another.*start*00689 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  7 APR 84 23:04 PSTFrom: MASINTER.PASubject: LispUsers packagesTo:   DONC@ISIFcc:   lispsupportDon,I don't know if I ever answered your message about LispUsers packages.

It should use the old region (or, more efficiently, reuse the old icon, even).Also, you should use the same filename pruner LaFite does so that files in your connected directory are represented without their device and directory.david*start*01039 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 02:10 PSTFrom: Wallace.paSubject: TEdit: New IO window is in the wrong placeTo: TEditSupport.paTEdit System Date:  6-Apr-84 16:45:56Lisp System Date:  8-Apr-84 18:02:02Machine: Dorado (Ventana)Microcode version: 24,2Memory size: 10000Frequency: AlwaysImpact: AnnoyingThe new tedit interaction window is created above the region created with the mouse (like titles were until recently).  This has two annoying effects:1> If you make a region that abuts another window (I know, most people like overlapping windows, but I don't) the interaction window will obscure some of the text in the window above it.2> If you make a region whose top is at the top edge of the screen, the interaction window is instantiated off the screen.  This means that it you select e.g. GET, the visible effect is that the caret stops blinking and responding to typein.  This is somewhat confusing.davidWhy don't you use something like EMACS.GET.REGIONS? *start*00577 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 03:14 PSTFrom: Wallace.paSubject: TEdit: Pops up window when giving up TTYTo: TEditSupport.paTEdit System Date:  6-Apr-84 16:45:56Lisp System Date:  8-Apr-84 18:02:02Machine: Dorado (Ventana)Microcode version: 24,2Memory size: 10000Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingOne of my Tedit windows always pops up a little window when it gives up the tty (which means every time it gets input from the promptwindow).

As a summaryof these packages:PQUOTE is, I think, a better version of the PQUOTE that you have (andperhaps ought to be part of the standard Interlisp).LostLists is only for Interlisp-10 (but it's quite useful there).Wakeup is fairly trivial, only useful if your terminal can beep.Comments is a documentation package (see how you like it).All simply organizes files by the word being defined, rather than byfilepkgtype.Tracein is a very useful debugging facility - one could make a pretty goodargument that it should be part of standard interlisp (the same argumentwould hold for EVALHOOK.) - works in every interlisp as far as I know.-------*start*00391 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  9 Apr 84 11:16 PSTFrom: Barrera.pasaSubject: New version of FXPRINTERTo: LispSupport.pacc: Barrera.pasaA new version of the FXPRINTER package has been moved to {PHYLUM}<LISPCORE>LIBRARY> along with updated documentation.

You also want to make sure that your new KEYHANDLER doesn't take up too much time -- the current one soaks up about 5% of all machine cycles, and if you're sloppy you could blow it up to 20% without much trouble.
