Actually, Tim mentions a more difficult problem - saving back releases of lisp (and lispusers packages). Though this was a bigger concern in the Chorus-to-Fugue transition, it concerns me that there appears to be no careful distinction of versions with the lispusers and lisp&gt;library files and not all of the releases get archived. Is this true? (Tim''s mention of no Chorus files on Phylum).''In our case - since I only pull over lispusers files as we need them due to space constraints - if we need a file that goes with the previous release (since Trillium is always a bit behind the new lisp release), I can''t be assured that I''ll find the compatible file (the file on {phylum}&lt;lispusers&gt; may be updated for the new release, and the old one is gone). For example, Doug decided to try running Lafite about a month ago, but due to the Carol release I don''t think he was able to find all of the files that he needed. We''re now only able to run Lafite on Carol which is not compatible with Halloween. This doesn''t seem like an easy thing to control, but maybe the only solution is to keep a full copy of {phylum}&lt;lispusers&gt; on Aztec.''Any thoughts?''-Kathy''     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 21':47':05Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: '[Date': 14 Mar 84 19':39 PST'From': masinter.pa'Subject': AR # 48'To': LispSupport''You should assign System/Subsystem and (hopefully Attn) to as many AR''s if you can.
