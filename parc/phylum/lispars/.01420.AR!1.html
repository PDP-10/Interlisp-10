Number: 1420Date: 14-Jun-84 14':59':30Submitter: Sannella.PASource: Masinter.paSubject: Automate release procedureLisp Version: Description: 'Description':one of the major sources of confusion between one release master 'and the next has been exactly what is done in the release process. We need at 'least a document and preferably a PROGRAM which automates the processes that 'happen when doing a variety of tasks for LispSupport. (Perhaps document with 'major procedures embodied in programs.) For example, I would like to retain the'wish that LispSupport take charge of updating the release directories on [Rose]', [Idun], [Ivan], [Aztec], and a number of other file servers which purport to 'hold the Interlisp-D release but in fact have old or out of date copies. 'Perhaps this is a job for Pasadena? They haven''t taken on the job of supporting'the internal Xerox interlisp-D user community; I''m reluctant to add that to 'their burden, since they are so overloaded that they would let it slide and our'internal reputation would slip.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Release ProcedureMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
