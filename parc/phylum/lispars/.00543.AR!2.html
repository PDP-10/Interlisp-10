''I had the worst time trying to convince my MESAARRAYs to redeclare themselves, since the text of the declarations had not changed': I finally had to redeclare each MESAARRAY with an off-the-wall definition, and then redeclare it again with its intended definition.  ''It would be nice if there were some documented way of causing a record to redeclare itself even if it didn''t think it needed to be.''-- Tayloe.''-----''Date':  5 APR 84 23':44 PST'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': re Record package &amp; redefining user record types'To':   stansbury'cc':   LispSupport''The manual doesn''t say how to do this.''The ''cache'' of records to their translations is stored in CLISPARRAY, so a (CLRHASH CLISPARRAY) should do it for you.''''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 17':52':13Attn: DocumentationAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Record PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
