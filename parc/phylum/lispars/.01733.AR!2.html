This is the most straightforward and least brutal way to abort, but does sometimes mean it takes a while.  I''ll look into doing it some other way, but I''m a little less confident of getting it "right" if I have to have the button click directly intervene in the message sending.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 14-Aug-84 14':53':42</pre>
