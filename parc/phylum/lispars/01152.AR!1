I did it for some experimentation and for wrap around scrolling for Jonl but I don''t want to advertise it yet.  This AR will be the reminder if it works out.''DSPEOLFN(FN DISPLAYSTREAM)  Returns the current value of the DSPEOLFN property of DISPLAYSTREAM.  If FN is NIL, this is all that it does.  If FN is ''OFF, the DSPEOLFN property is cleared.  If FN is LITATOM, it should be a function of one argument  (the display stream) which will be called whenever an EOL is printed on DISPLAYSTREAM.  If FN is anything else, an error is generated.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 19-May-84 15':33':43Attn: burtonAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
