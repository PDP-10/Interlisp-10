In the general case,  a user will button on some  item <FOO> then  UNDO,  SWAP  and then <FOO>  again.  it would be nice if a user  could add a menu item ("OOPS"  perhaps?)  that would do this for her/him or perhaps it should be standard.   Of course,  more  general user extensablity of  the deditor would be nice as well.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-May-84 17':27':37Attn: Sheil.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: 5121Memory Size: 3584File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Source Files:
