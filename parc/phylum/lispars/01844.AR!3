The system goes back and forth between the working vmem and a saved one, and every once and a while, swaps (e.g., when there hasn''t been a lot of activity.) Thus, you can lose work, but not a lot, if your system crashes or your machine boots.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date:  6-Sep-84 22':31':37
