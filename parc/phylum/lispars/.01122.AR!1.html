E.g., if you break PACKFILENAME, all you get is U = n, which is very frustrating.  Would be nice if the break package could display the actual arguments somehow.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 18-May-84 12':25':45Attn: Burton, MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Break PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
