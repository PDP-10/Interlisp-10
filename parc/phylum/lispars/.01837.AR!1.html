Number: 1837Date: 14-Aug-84 13':23':01Submitter: MasinterSource: MasinterSubject: attempt to CONN {unixhost} without dir fails, should go to login dirLisp Version:  7-Aug-84 15':57':18Description: This works for most hosts -- if you just say CONN {MAXC} it connects you to your ''login'' directory on the host. Doesn''t seem to work for Unix, e.g. CONN {MARXC}.''CONN {MARXC}&lt;/user/masinter/&gt; seems to work, however. It does seem to upper-case the "user/masinter" even when Unix wants it lowercase.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 14-Aug-84 13':23':01Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: VAX ServerMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 3071File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
