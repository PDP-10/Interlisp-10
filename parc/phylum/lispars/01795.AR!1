Need more examples of macros. "''At the very least, the section on NLAMBDAs should mention this problem.  NLAMBDAs are useful, in the situation where you WANT to quote all of the arguments.  The system NLAMBDA functions that I can think of (SETQ, etc.) get around these problems by compiling inline.''"This is prompted by interchange viz TRILLIUM.PRINTOUT -- how did they go astray?"''I am not sure.  They are saying ''why did the system change beneath us'', but currently I suspect that they changed something (like setting LOCALVARS _ T).'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Stack and InterpreterMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
