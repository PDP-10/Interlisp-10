It''d work on a dolphin, too.  All you need is a little box to connect across the phone line to pulse it (like rotary dial phones do).  Touch tone dialling is a little more expensive, but it is faster (of course).  The port would toggle the CTS line or something on the TTY port and the Lisp program will simulate the dialling.  You could have a desktop phone icon and press people''s names in a menu when you wanted to call someone!!   The dandelion will use the RS232 port, the parallel port, or the dolphin will use the parallel port.  I don''t think it''s woth it for a dorado.''Is that what you wanted to know?''/Mitch.'''Date': 11 May 84 03':16 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': AR submitted on limited length of Attn and In/By fields'To': Sannella'cc': JonL.pa''I think I should be Attn''d on AR 1010, since JSB also asked me personaly to scout around for equipment.  But Mitch''s name is so long that there isn''t room enough to add anyone else.  This problem also pops up under the System/Subsystem section "Storage formats/Mgt" where the names listed in LispARFields.txt are "vanMelle.pa, Kaplan.pa, Jonl.pa", a phrase over 10 characters longer than the allotment.''-- JonL --''''I built such a box and connected it to the parallel port.
