E.g., was this immediately after returning from Logout; was the browser in any unusual state when you clicked GetMail; and most importantly, what exactly was the stack?''General comment':  BT! is much more helpful than BT.  And when you get a NON-NUMERIC ARG error, you can usually find a frame at the top of the stack that actually shows the numeric computation that caused the error, and perhaps report what the other arguments to it were.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Apr-84 14':36':29Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
