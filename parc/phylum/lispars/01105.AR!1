If users want to customize their fontset, then we should still go thru the indirection of FONTPROFILE. First, that will allow us to change fontsets gracefully, e.g., by picking a different font profile for the demo for bigger fonts, and leads to a far more consistent style. It means that we won''t have all these funny fonts wired in if we want to switch to the NS fonts and character sets, etc.'''Filebrowser reminded me of this, but there are some other offenders around too (e.g., Lafite, the menu fonts in TEdit, etc).'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 12-May-84 15':28':50Attn: LispAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: FontsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
