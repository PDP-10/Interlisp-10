I once suggested a mode where you could mark a message for movement, but it would take place until an update (at which point I am willing to accept a delay).  I''d like to register my vote once more.''		Kris'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  8-May-84 17':30':26Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: '[Date':  9 Apr 84 13':05 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'AR 392': Diff Hard]System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files:
