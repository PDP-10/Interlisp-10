TYP/FORM).  There are some problems':''(RESET.INTERRUPTS'  (LIST (CONS (CHARCODE ^C) ''FOOBAR)))''will cause "Undefined interrupt - 3 - disabling" to be printed in the prompt window when ^C is typed.''(RESET.INTERRUPTS'  (LIST (LIST (CHARCODE ^C) ''FOOBAR)))''has the same effect as''(INTERRUPTCHAR (CHARCODE ^C) ''FOOBAR)''i.e., it immediately sets FOOBAR to T whenever ^c is typed.''and''(RESET.INTERRUPTS'  (LIST (LIST (CHARCODE ^C) ''(NILL))))''causes a "Shouldn''t happen!" under INTERRUPTED whenever ^C is typed.''Workaround': Use INTERRUPTCHAR.''Other deficiency':  it would seem that there is no way to specify the HARDFLG on RESET.INTERRUPTS.  Why not allow the items to have the full generality; i.e.,''       (CHAR TYP/FORM HARDFLG)'''---Jim' '-----''Date': 26 Apr 84 12':08 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': RESET.INTERRUPTS problems'In-reply-to': desRivieres.pa''s message of 26 Apr 84 00':27 PST'To': desRivieres.pa'cc': LispSupport.pa''This is a bug in the documentation -- the full generality of the form is'   (CHAR TYP/FORM HARDFLG)'rather than what''s in the manual --  (CHAR .
