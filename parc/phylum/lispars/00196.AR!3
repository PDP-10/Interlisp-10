We need a category for Interlisp-10 only bugs. Changed ATTN to Masinter. Set priority down since Interlisp-10 not supported, especially not PUP, and simple workaround]Description: '[lmm': This is a problem with the Interlisp-10 version of PUPFTP being confused about the call to passwords. It calls (LOGIN) where it should call (\INTERNAL/GETPASSWORD). The only reason this isn''t absolutely trivial is that there is some confusion in my mind whether we have a consistent set of Interlisp-10 sources for PUP.]''Date': 18 MAR 84 23':14 PST'From': KAPLAN.PA'Subject': LOGIN to Phylum from 10 Lisp fails'To':   LISPSUPPORT''I had PUPFTP loaded on Maxc and tried to see my directory on Phylum':''DIR {PHYLUM}<KAPLAN>LISP>''It asked me to login to Phylum, and simply wouldn''t believe my password'(whether typed in upper or lower case).''This resembles problems that used to crop up in D.  Perhaps the 10 has the older version of the code?''--Ron'------'Date': 18 MAR 84 23':19 PST'From': KAPLAN.PA'Subject': More on Maxc password problem'To':   LISPSUPPORT''I had asked for'DIR {PHYLUM}<KAPLAN>LISP'and had the password problem.''When I did an EXEC to send the previous message and returned back to Lisp,'I tried'DIR {PHYLUM}<KAPLAN>LISP>*'which is what I had really wanted.  This worked fine.''But then when I retried'DIR {PHYLUM}<KAPLAN>LISP'I got different behavior':  instead of the password problem, I got a file not found message, which is what I would have expected in the first place.''I don''t understand why it got better the second time.  Doubt that the EXEC had anythng to do with it.  Perhaps the login had taken effect in the first DIR, but that the code was such that it didn''t get noticed until I backed out to the top and tried again.''--Ron'Workaround: [lmm': simple workaround in Interlisp-10': call (LOGIN) first.]Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date: 30-Jun-84 00':22':51
