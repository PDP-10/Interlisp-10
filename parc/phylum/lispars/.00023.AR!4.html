The demand for this will determine the priority.  I am aware of a desire for fixed-pitch grain; how about others?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  5-Jun-84 17':15':08Attn: SybalskyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
