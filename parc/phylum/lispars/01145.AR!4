The CORE device fails as a destination because it ignores the CREATIONDATE parameter passed to OPENFILE, and instead assigns the current date and time as the new file''s creation date.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':07':38Attn: Assigned To: vanMelleIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
