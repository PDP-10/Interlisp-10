(I think the proper thing on documentation requests is to categorize them with System/Subsystem of the area that needs the documentation, in this case, Language/Storage. Mike was lumping them all under Documentation/Reference Manual, but I think those are probably reserved for areas where it is form, not content, that needs work.)''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 30-Apr-84 12':49':23Attn: Assigned To: In/By: AR 838Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Storage Formats/MgtMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: Priority: Status: SupersededProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
