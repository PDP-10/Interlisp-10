In this case, you contributed greatly to help us identifying the problem, and then Bill Norwicki provided the fix.  I just want you to deserve the credit you entitled.''Now, I have another question to ask. (hope you dont mind.)  On your using the InstallLispTool to talk to TOPS-20 and Unix, do you have any problem of specifying the file name, i.e. did you follow the syntax as [server]<directory>Subdirectory>filename.sys(out)?  We have encountered a "cryptic" syntax when tlaking to another Vax server, I am just trying to find out you whether the same problem is occuring on these two implementations?  Thanks.''/Jerry'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JFung.pasaEdit-Date: 21-May-84 16':07':25Attn: JFung/DEIAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: 	The story is DEI claims to accept both angle brackets or none.  However, in using the Pilot''s File Tool, DEI rejects even both angle brackets are specified, but will accept if both square brackets are used instaed.  This is because the VMS''s file pathname is like [Directory.Subdirectory]fileName.ext  The VMS uses square brackets instaed of the angle brackets.  The LIT has been changed to strip out both angle brackets when talking to any PUP implementations. ''I''ve asked Christopher Schmidt at Sumex to confirm the new workaround will indeed work on DEC 2060 PUP implementation.  And he tried without the left angle bracket and it worked.'System: CommunicationsSubsystem: PUP ProtocolsMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: VAX/VMS - 10MbServer Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: FixedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
