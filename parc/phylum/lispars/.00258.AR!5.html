Blue-bugging "sendmail" brought up this form and defaulted the registry to NIL after my name even though my name is Marshall.wbst on the disk and the other password modules seem to set their registry ok. Attempts to send the message resulted in "Illegal RName" and "no server responded" messages. This was confusing. I figured out what happened by monitoring the ethernet. I would suggest either picking off the registry from the disk name or having some menu-driven way to set and reset the registry. A clearer error message (e.g., "Marshall.NIL is not a valid name") would also be nice.''The above is not a complaint as I think the lisp system is one of the best going.''--Sidney''-----''Date': 27 Mar 84 16':06 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#258 Registry setting'To': Marshall.wbst'cc': LafiteSupport''Yes, Lafite should take the hint from your disk name; it currently is going thru an interface that strips off the registry therefrom.''Meanwhile, Lafite works quite nicely if you set DEFAULTREGISTRY to your local registry (e.g. WBST).  This is a variable that is expected to be set in the site init file (the thing that lives as {dsk}init.lisp).  Mention of it was inadvertantly left out of the Lafite documentation.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date:  5-Jun-84 14':18':30</pre>
