This can be very frustrating; in the case of a message Larry sent there was an object that was more than half the height of my window tall; when I tried to scroll downward at the end of the text, it looked like tedit was stuck.  A related problem to (2) is that if the top line of the window is tall, and I ask to scroll a small amount, it still scrolls the entire top line out of the window.''(2) would be slightly better if the scrolling routine rounded to the nearest number of lines, rather than truncating.  But better still, if you can get Tedit to display lines that are only partially in the window, is to have some minimum scroll distance (e.g., if I ask to scroll by more than 30 points, you always scroll something, even if it''s merely a portion of a 100-point hight line).
