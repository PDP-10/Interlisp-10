Also, make it NOT do an automatic NEW when it starts up.  Given how slow New is, and the fact that half the time that I bring up AR.FORM it''s to examine/edit an old AR, I''d rather the window came up blank and waited for me to choose something to do.''-----''Date':  9 May 84 14':03 PDT'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': New AREDIT on LispUsers'In-reply-to': Sannella.PA''s message of 9 May 84 13':49':21 PDT (Wednesday)'To': Sannella.PA''How about making AR.FORM accessible from the background menu instead of ARShow?  Maybe also as "lisp Bug" with the appropriate fields filled in.''Richard'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 14':51':06</pre>
