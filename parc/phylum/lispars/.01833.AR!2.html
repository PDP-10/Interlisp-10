The problem is that DEFAULTSUBITEMFN is trying to take the CADDDR of a menu item that is a dotted list.  This winds up trying to take the CDR of a non-list.'     So, either the current (CADDDR ITEM) in DEFAULTSUBITEMFN''s code should be written more carefully, or else it should be documented in the manual that menu items should not be dotted lists, and the HISTMENU package should be fixed.''rrb': fixed.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Burton.paEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 17':26':28</pre>
