Number: 1180Date: 21-May-84 17':23':05Submitter: Sannella.PASource: AHenderson.paSubject: Include version identification info with release of system, packagesLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 15 May 84 10':28 PDT'From': AHenderson.pa'Subject': Lisp': Release announcements&gt;'To': LispSupport.pa, LafiteSupport.pa, TEditSupport.pa'cc': AHenderson.pa''Lisp System Date': 12-May-84 16':10':36'Machine': Dorado (AHenderson)'Microcode version': 24,2'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': Always'Impact': Very annoying''Folk':''Context': I reinitialize Lisp non-uniformly across my many partitions on a when-needed basis. I receive an announcement of a "new" lisp thing (Sysout, Tedit, Lafite, ...).''Problem': I have trouble identifying whether or not I am running in that "new" version yet or not. ''Suggestion': Pick out some way of identifying each of these versions and publish that along with the release announcement. Thjis identification method should be effective both from within a running Lisp and from the exec. Filenames, file version  numbers, and file dates suggest themselves, but I am also ready to use such mechanisms as a variable (how about LAFITE.VERSION) put early on the COMS of the main file so that one could also Type the file at the exec (or SEE it from Lisp) to determine its identity.''I can see from the Lafite report forms for these various systems that system dates are used for identification in bug/suggestion reports. Maybe all you need to do is include these in the announcement messages.
