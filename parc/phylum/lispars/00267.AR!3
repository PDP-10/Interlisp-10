There seems to be no easy way of seeing those messages nicely formatted in Lafite.  I have to muck around to get the font changed from the variable pitch font that I prefer for most messages, and even after doing that, the tabs are not right.''I''d like a toggle, perhaps on a middle-button popup in the message display window, that goes back and forth to TTY display mode (fixed pitch font, 8 space tabs, perhaps automatically extending the window how to a a minimum of 72 or 80 spaces).  I''d also like the hardcopy of a message being displayed in such a mode to be in TTY mode also (recall my earlier request to have a hardcopy button attached to the message display window as well as the browser).  But the hardcopy toggle should of course be available for messages not being displayed, as an option in the wished for middle-button subcommand pop-up on the browser hardcopy button.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 25-May-84 12':59':21
