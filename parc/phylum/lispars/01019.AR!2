I rewrote it entirely; the result is VolumeAllocationMap.dcom, which in addition to seeming correct, is considerably faster.  It is fully compatible with Mesa 10.0.  -- Tayloe StansburyWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':23':05Attn: Assigned To: stansburyIn/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 3071File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
