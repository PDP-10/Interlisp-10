Number: 1375Date:  8-Jun-84  9':57':52Submitter: WallaceSource: WallaceSubject: \LEAF.FLUSH.CACHE spawns 16 processesLisp Version:  3-Jun-84 16':29':06Description: Yesterday morning when phylum was increadibly loaded I hung for over an hour trying to write a file.  I noticed that 16 processes were spawned under the name \LEAF.FLUSH.CACHE(#xx).  What were they?  I had 0 files open at that time according to (OPENP).  I logged out, and when I logged in 11 hours later they didn''t go away, even though Phylum was happy.  I eventually killed them off, which seemed to have no ill effect.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-Jun-84  9':57':52Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: PUP ProtocolsMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
