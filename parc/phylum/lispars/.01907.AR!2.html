There is this comment in its code': "Passes over non-separators (sic) to peek at the first non-separator on FILE.  Returns either last peeked character, or NIL if no non-seprs left in the file."  If, for example, I want to write my own LOAD function that does not count on atom STOP being in my file, it is convenient to use READ, EOFP, and a non-erroring SKIPSEPRS. ''-----''If SKIPSEPRS gets an error on eof, it is becaue the device \PEEKBIN function is not honoring the noerror flg.  What device is the file on?''--RonWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: KaplanEdit-Date: 15-Sep-84 03':05':14</pre>
