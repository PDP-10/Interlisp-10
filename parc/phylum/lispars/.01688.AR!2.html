The demonstrator said'that the operating system was multitasking, and that it frequently'started up processes.  He also mentioned that the mouse was handled'by a background process.''During the demo, in the top level window (is this the correct term?),'I tried to find the 27th number in the fibonacci sequence.  This was'taking several minutes, (interpreted code) so I moved the mouse to an'empty portion of the screen, and asked how I would I create another'top level window.''To my surprise, I was told I couldn''t.  There is only one "top level"'window at a time.''Is this true?  Essentially, I wanted to create another process to'talk to.  Had I just asked the wrong thing?  I would have thought I'could type':''(ADD.PROCESS (read-eval-loop) NAME WINDOW2)''Of course, I would have to find out the name of Interlisp''s'read-eval-loop....''Then, a window would be created for this when it requested I/O, and'I''d be in business.''Is this not so?  Why not?''Thanks,''Jerry Bakin.''-----''Return-Path': &lt;@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA':Mittal.pa@Xerox.ARPA&gt;'Redistributed': Xerox1100UsersGroup&uarr;.PA'Received': from SUMEX-AIM.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 29 JUN 84 09':14':53 PDT'Received': from Xerox.ARPA by SUMEX-AIM.ARPA with TCP; Fri 29 Jun 84 08':31':58-PDT'Received': from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 29 JUN 84 08':32':51 PDT'Date': 29 Jun 84 08':32 PDT'From': Mittal.pa'Subject': Re': [re': multiprocess query]'In-reply-to': GREENFELD@BBNG.ARPA''s message of 29 Jun 84 07':51 EDT'To': GREENFELD@BBNG.ARPA'cc': 1100users@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA''One can create other "Top level" processes by running the USEREXEC'function in a separate process. The problem faced by the person in your'story is that once the lisp exec is tied up in some computation you have'to find some way of executing the ADD.PROCESS call (one possibility is'to do inside a break). In the Loops Sysouts, buttoning the LoopsIcon'with the left button now gives an option of creating another User exec.''Return-Path': &lt;RICHER@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA&gt;'Redistributed': Xerox1100UsersGroup&uarr;.PA'Received': from SUMEX-AIM.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 03 AUG 84 11':35':30 PDT'Date': Fri, 3 Aug 84 10':35':50 PDT'From': Mark Richer &lt;RICHER@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA&gt;'Subject': add.process &amp; userexec'To': 1100users@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA'''I have found doing a (ADD.PROCESS ''(USEREXEC)) very useful and have even put it on a utility menu so I can call it more easily.  I would like to add several'features, but I''m having difficulty':'	(1) I would like to give the new userexec process the tty process'immediately, and it seems a way to do this is to do a (GIVE.TTYPROCESS to'the new process''s window.  Doing the ADD.PRCESS creates and automatically'opens a TTY window for the process, but doing a (PROCESSPROP process ''WINDOW)'returns NIL, and looking in inspect window also show PROCWINDOW to be'NIL.  What does this mean?'	(2) OKay, so I thought I could define my own window by adding the'prop-value pair ''WINDOW mywindow to  the ADD.PROCESS call; this creates'two windows (my test was (ADD.PROCESS ''(USEREXEC) ''WINDOW (CREATEW ] ).'BUTTONING EITHER WINDOW GIVES THE TTY PORCESS TO THE USEREXEC, BUT YOU CAN'ONLY TYPE IN THE TTY WINDOW CREATED BY LISP.  HOWEVER, THE PROCWINDOW FOR'THE PROCESS IS INDEED THE ONE I CREATED.  PERHAPS, THIS IS BEHAVIOR IS'EXPLAINIED IN THE MANUAL.  IF SO , PLEASE POINT THE WAY.'	(3) I WOULD also like the WINDOW so I can close it after the userexec'returns (BY TYPING OK) or after the process is killed. The default is the'window just sits there, and I think that''s a bit deceiving.
