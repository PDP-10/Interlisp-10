Progs, gos, etc. are none to swift interpreted in our system.''Most other lisps have put more into specialized hand coded interpreters (in microcode or assembler).'...'b) need RECLAIM on code blocks to free constants (if you FCOMPILE and throw results away a lot, it can add up to a lot more garbage not being collected; this one is only Moderatly hard.)'...Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Storage Formats/MgtMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
