For the latter, this meant doing LISTFILES of approximately 26 files on a Sunday evening.  Unfortunately, so many LISTFILES processes get created that there is a STACK OVERFLOW error, presumably because PROCESS world stack allocation is swamped with too many requests.  The old LISTFILES probably would not have had this problem.  Now I''ll have to kludge some DISMISS''s in between LISTFILES on the machine that is doing the hardcopying for me.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 12':56':43
