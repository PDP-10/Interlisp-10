ECHOMODE'does check its argument. (HARDRESET) gets the machine going again.'------''As far as I can tell, GETECHOMODE does check its only argument, to insure that it specifies a terminal table.  It generates an ILLEGAL TERMINAL TABLE error if it is not, in exactly the same way that ECHOMODE does.  So I don''t understand what the problem is.  The only way I can imagine getting a 9915 is if GETECHOMODE is called with interrupts turned off.  Is this the case?''Of course, I was trying this on a Dorado.   If you believe that this does bomb out on a dlion even when running interruptably, please confirm this with a new explicit test.  In the meantime, I have marked this AR as "declined".''--Ron''-----''Date': 30 Aug 84 08':49 PDT'From': Wogulis.pasa'Subject': Re': Ar 2017 declined'In-reply-to': Kaplan.pa''s message of 29 Aug 84 23':45 PDT'To': Kaplan.pa'cc': Wogulis.pasa, MGittins.RX, Lispsupport.pa''On an 1108 with':'Lispversion': 37120 (Carol)'Microcodeversion': 5124'BCPLVersion': 9216''(GETECHOMODE T) falls into 9318''from teleraid':''@LLisp stack in TeleRaid Context'  1': \MP.ERROR'  2': \LISPERROR'  3': \GTTERMTABLE'  4': ECHOMODE'  5': GETECHOMODE'  6': \EVALFORM'  7': EVAL'  8': LISPX'  9': ERRORSET' 10': EVALQT' 11': \REPEATEDLYEVALQT' 12': \EVALFORM' 13': ERRORSET' 14': \MAKE.PROCESS0' 15': T''---Jim''--------'Looking further, I discovered that this was a problem in Carol that had already been fixed in Harmony.
