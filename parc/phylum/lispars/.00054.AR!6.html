It would be nice to be able to say "MoveTo unless I already did" and "Hardcopy unless I already did". Hardcopy would require remembering with the message whether it had been hardcopied. MoveTo could look': filter on message length, and then compare the message (or just first part and last part). Alternatively, remembering all the "hjappenings" since a message was placed in this folder, available by buttoning the mark letter with middle button would solve the same problem. Or all of the above.''Austin''-------'Date': 16 May 84 14':05 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Lafite': The "mark" letter doesn''t summarize history'To': LafiteSupport.pa'cc': JonL.pa''Lafite System Date':  8-Apr-84 17':20':45'Lisp System Date': 14-May-84 21':12':25'Machine': Dolphin (BuickoSaurus)'Microcode version': 24,1'Memory size': 7000'Frequency': Always'Impact': Annoying''If one answers a mesage, it gets an "a" mark; then if he subsequently hardcopies it, it gets an "h", thereby destroying the information that it was answered.
