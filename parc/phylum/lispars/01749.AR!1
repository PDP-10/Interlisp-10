I often waste time clicking around to get the scrollbar to come up because it is so slow that I think I missed the trigger.  In fact, it wasn''t until I set the waittime to 0 that I realized I didn''t have to click the inside of the window immediately before moving to the scrollbar.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
