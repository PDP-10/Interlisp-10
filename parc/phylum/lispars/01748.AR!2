The connection to SUMEX seemed to hang.  For some dumb reason, I decided to just close the CHAT connection to MAXC.  I selected the CLOSE option on the middle-button menu but nothing happened.  I selected CLOSE on the right button menu.  That put it into some kind of loop in which it was going into GC every couple of seconds. I got a PSW and tried KILL, but this didn''t have any effect.  I managed to stop the thing by ^C to RAID and ^D.  The CHAT typein process was stuck in TAILP in RESETRESTORE in \BSP.PREPARE.OUTPUT in \BSP.GETNEXTBUFFER.  ''Note': I saw something similar to this happen to Jeff Shrager yesterday, except that when he did it, even ^C didn''t work (I guess because CHAT was the current TTY process as well).  He had to abandon the lisp image.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 30-Aug-84 17':20':46
