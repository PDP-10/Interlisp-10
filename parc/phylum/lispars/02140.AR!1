After doing RESETDEDIT, my TAB key no longer works.  It seems that DEDIT messes with the TAB key in order to handle the "snuggle-up" menu, and somehow, either during the tangling or during the RESETDEDIT, I lost my tab key.  RESETDEDIT should restore the TAB key definition just to be sure.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
