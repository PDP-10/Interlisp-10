It is hard to do this well.Description: The technical summary should address some of the misconceptions about our machine architecture. I started to write some stuff, but didn''t put it in  a polished form.''VanBuer': "Dandelion and Dolphin have 16-bit ALUs, as a result most arithmetic is pretty slow"'The 16-bit ALU has little to do with arithmetic performance. Dandelion looks quite competitive, especially on small integer arithmetic. The hardware/microcode floating point is also competitive with most other lisp machines.' ''vanBuer claimed limited control store. 'The 1108 with extended control store (1108X? dunno what they are going to call it) will have more graphics primitives in microcode (e.g., line drawing.) As far as I can tell after using a 3600 for a while, a Dandelion is comperable to a 3600 for graphics processing (at least, without their color hardware board, since the memory bandwidth is in the same ballpark). ''He was concerned about the inability of DLion architecturally to support color. Steve, can a DLion support high performance color processing?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 31-May-84 15':27':07</pre>
