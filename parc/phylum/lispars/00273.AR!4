By tracing thru \PUSHTEXT, it appears that the program had gotten as far as finishing a call to BKBITBLT which happened to be the last instruction on a page.  The code looks like''624':	15 12 7 316		FNX(12)	BKBITBLT'-----page break here-----'630':	277			POP'631':	105			IVAR		TEXTOBJ''Pc 1632 is, of course, almost exactly a page later.
