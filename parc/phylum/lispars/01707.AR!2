You have keynames for the left shift key (LSHIFT), the blank keys (BLANK-TOP, -MIDDLE, -BOTTOM), but not for the control key.  I have figured out that the keyname is CTRL.  This should be in a next release of the manual.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 27-Jul-84 14':52':21Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: DocumentationSubsystem: Interlisp Reference ManualMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
