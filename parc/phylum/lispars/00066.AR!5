(you may run one tool at a time, but activate multiple tools the machine will crash, I suspect no more disk pages).''In stead of increasing its size say by another 200 pages (I think 200 is sufficient), it is argued that we should not take the disk space away from customes.''Unless we change promethus.script, it will be each Adobe user''s responsibility to make sure his Diagnostic volume is large enough to run Adobe.''I personally like to see Diag. volume size be increased from Promethus.script.  Most machines here are formatted via Installation Utility floppy (it is easier than Othello, and a standard procedure), and I would like to see walking to one of them and be able to use Adobe.

Look at [phylum]<Lisp>Current>*.othello. There are several that are used for partitioning the disk. If you would like one that made the Tajo/Diagnostics volume bigger, why don''t you discuss it with their authors or else make one tailored for your use.

Say ''Open Lisp/w'Create <Lisp>'Push <Lisp>''This will basically "connect" you to a Tajo directory on the Lisp volume. Of course, the files will go away if you erase the volume, but if you are temporarily stuck with a machine without enough space to run Adobe, you can get more that way.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 11-Apr-84 17':38':57Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
