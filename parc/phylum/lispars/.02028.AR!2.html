Unfortunately, you didn''t give us much information.  In particular, what was the MAKESYSDATE of the lisp sysout (the one loaded on the Dlion where the SYSOUT was made)?  I seem to remember that Martin Gittens took back with him a pre-Carol release version of the lisp sysout.  This version may have had the problem you mentioned.''I don''t have any workaround handy -- perhaps when Tayloe gets back next week he can think of something that you can do.'' -----''From': mgittins.rx'Date':  6-Sep-84 14':56':59'Subject': re AR2028'To': sannella.pa'cc': lispsupport.pa'''re AR2028''thank you for your reply.
