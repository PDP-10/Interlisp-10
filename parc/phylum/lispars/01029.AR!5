Under Fugue.6, I get a nasty break complaining about inability to create so small a window.''------------''I tried creating an empty menu and adding it to existing windows and old windows and didn''t get a break.  This was in 14-may <lispcore>next> so something may have changed since fugue6.  Maybe you could get more specific details from Eric and reproduce it(?).''richard'-------''Eric has provided more information on the problem with ADDMENU breaks.  The problem is not that it is impossible to bring up a menu with no entries.  The real problem was trying to evaluate (fetch (MENU IMAGEHEIGHT) of MENU) on such a menu not yet popped up on the screen.  The definition of the MENU record causes such a fetch to call \CHECK\MENU\IMAGE, which eventually ends up calling CREATEW with DONTOPENFLG set to T, and you get an error.  Thisdidn''t used to happen in Fugue.4.

I found another (ar 1114) which had the same msgs but had a status of fixed so I may have answered that one instead.
