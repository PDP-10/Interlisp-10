The only problem is that I did run into a small bug with it.  If the TEdit stream is not referring to a file (i.e., if you''ve just opened an empty window without saving it out to a file), SHRINKW breaks with an illegal argument NIL because it doesn''t have anything to label the icon with.  This of course brings up the question as to what label to come up with when the TEdit stream isn''t associated with a file.  May I suggest the first two words of the text.  If the stream consists only of an IMAGEOBJ, perhaps the word "IMAGE" could be the label.''Perhaps all of this has already been worked out?''--Ken.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 18-Aug-84 11':40':38</pre>
