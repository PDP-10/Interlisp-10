I''d like this to happen quietly without the need for user intervention.  Unfortunately, when the file is first created, you get a TTY window for MOUSE asking "new file?" to which you have to reply yes, and on subsequent saves you get another window with a "Can''t find original version, shall I TCOMPL it instead".  Is there any way to avoid this, and if not can I put that in as a request for some future release?  Thanks.''			- Michel''-----'''Sender': Sannella.PA'Date': 21 May 84 16':20':50 PDT (Monday)'Subject': Re': Lisp': MAKEFILE'In-reply-to': Denber.wbst''s message of 14 May 84 15':47 EDT'To': Denber.wbst'cc': LispSupport'From': LispSupport.pa'Reply-To': LispSupport.pa''You want to call MAKEFILE from the user without the need for user intervention.  If you call MAKEFILE with the OPTIONS = (C NEW), it will not try to copy old source or compiled code, so you won''t get the "Can''t find original version, shall I TCOMPL it instead" message.  Getting rid of the "new file?" message is a little harder.  This is generated by the function ADDTOFILE when you try to add a definition to an unknown file.  Question': how do you generate the filecoms for the new files?  I think that if you just consed them up yourself, and called makefile, that you shouldn''t have any problems.''i.e.''(PROGN (SETQ FOOCOMS ''((FNS BAR)))'      (MAKEFILE ''FOO]' 'Contact me if this doesn''t work...''(sorry about taking so long to answer... its been a busy week.)'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: KaplanAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: File PackageMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
