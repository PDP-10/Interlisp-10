It ran okay (i.e., without error msgs.).  But when I tried to start the thing up, it came back with the msg "Somethings wrong"  and then died.  Now I ask, what kind of assinine msg is "Somethings wrong"??''It took me an hour to figure out what the problem really was when a simple informative error msg (at the right time) would have told me immediately.'''Frank''-----''Date': 10 May 84 12':14':14 PDT (Thursday)'From': JFung.pasa'Subject': Re': AR 1051': Please change InstallLispTool error message': "Somethings wrong"'In-reply-to': Sannella.PA''s message of 9 May 84 13':09':58 PDT (Wednesday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': JFung, 1100Support, Raim, Dering, Le, wogulis'''I believe this msg of "Somethings wrong" is from the Prometheus boot file on the floppy and not from the InstallLispTool.  Sorry, I cant help on this, until I got the sources to look at.''Now, the problem as he stated is because user install a sysout (say 5 floppies) into the BootLisp volume which is never large enough to handle it, but it lets you did it.  This is a bug on the script.  ''I''ve checked the disk configurations, the 29Mb''s BootLisp is 8395 pages, and the 42Mb''s disk is 13174 pages.  A full floppy is 2200 pages.  So there are potential problems of using 29Mb disk to install 4 FULL floppies.  This will be corrected.''.....'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: jfung.pasaEdit-Date: 26-Jun-84 14':45':54
