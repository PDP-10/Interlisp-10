For instance, it would be nice to say "Kill TEDIT and all of its data types" or "Kill Dedit" or "Kill LAFITE".  While there is a speed advantage to having all of these specialized data types, there is definitely a space cost, and I am suffering from it.''--Tom'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinterEdit-Date:  6-Sep-84 22':30':29</pre>
