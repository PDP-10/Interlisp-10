'''Date':  6 AUG 84 22':32 PDT'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': proposal for incompatible default settings ....'To':   LispCore&uarr;''I propose making two changes in default system settings before Harmony':''a) change DWIM to default (CLISPDEC ''MIXED) rather than (CLISPDEC ''INTEGER). That would mean that''(A+B) would turn into (PLUS A B) rather than (IPLUS A B), and (add X 3) would use PLUS, and (for I from 1 to 10 sum N) would use PLUS and GREATERP for the iteration, and PLUS for accumulating the sum.''I believe that all of our microcodes including 4K DLion now implement PLUS for integers exactly as efficiently as IPLUS. I think IPLUS is anachronistic and has resulted in a number of bug reports and obscure confusions.''There *is* a possibility that some odd piece of the system will stop working with this change, but I sort of doubt it.... the only difference is in the case where you do''(for I from X to Y ...) and Y/X are floating point arguments.''There is also a possibility that some odd case of PLUS/TIMES etc *doesn''t* work the same or as fast, and that something will suddenly become dreadfully slower, but I also doubt it.''Every other modern lisp defaults to generic arithmetic in lieu of other declarations. If you *SAY* explicitly IPLUS, you should of course get IPLUS, but if you don''t say or say implicitly, this would change the default.'''. . .'Date':  7 Aug 84 18':06 PDT'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': proposal for incompatible default settings ....'In-reply-to': MASINTER.PA''s message of 6 AUG 84 22':32 PDT'To': MASINTER.PA'cc': LispCore&uarr;.PA''Although I think the changes that Larry is proposing are desirable things to do, I don''t think this is the time to fool around with pervasive system declarations.  This is the sort of thing that should be done not just before a release but just after, when there is a long time for all the hidden bugs to surface.  There is bound to be a long exponential tail on this.''I think the harmony release message should warn users that we intend to do this on the following release.''Date': 13 Aug 84 12':44 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': Re': proposal for incompatible default settings ....'In-reply-to': MASINTER.PA''s message of 6 AUG 84 22':32 PDT'To': MASINTER.PA'cc': LispCore&uarr;.PA, 1100Support.pasa''The proposal to change the Interlisp default declaration from (CLISPDEC ''INTEGER) to (CLISPDEC ''MIXED) is certainly overdue.  Since this will be an incompatible change, I suggest that we resurrect the "announcement" letter about the pending ZEROP change, and extend it to include this one;  thus we can warn the user community some months in advance of the delivery of sysouts with these changes installed.'''-- JonL --'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date:  2-Sep-84 15':23':31</pre>
