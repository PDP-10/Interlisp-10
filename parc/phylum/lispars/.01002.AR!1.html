It prompts the user for a date by displaying a menu that looks like a calendar.  ''DATEMENU(MONTH YEAR)''Puts up a menu that looks like a calendar and returns a string of the day the user selected.  The value returned is of the form "dd-mon-yy 00':00':00" which is an acceptable input to IDATE.  MONTH should be the first 3 letters of the month (e.g. JUL, DEC).  YEAR should be the last 2 digits of the year (e.g. 83).  The initial menu will be of the month MONTH in the year YEAR defaulting to the current month and year.  The calendar has the preceding and following months in the upper corners; selecting one of these changes the menu month to the selected month.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  7-May-84  9':22':44Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: Status: FixedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
