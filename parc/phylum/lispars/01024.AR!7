This might be only across multipl lines or across double-quotes.  It''s literally intermittent.  The cursor always bops away from the end of the line as if it''s going off to flash the matcher, but it doesn''t flash at the match some of the time.''-- Jeff''-----''Date':  7 May 84 21':27 PDT'From': Shrager.pa'Subject': Lisp': paren flash again'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Shrager.pa''Lisp System Date':  7-May-84 16':18':26'Machine': Dorado (CISDORADO8)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': n/a'Impact': n/a''I figured out what''s up.  If you hold shift, the cursor disappears!  Is this a new feature?!  If so, I''d like to vote that it be abolshied asap.

It refuses to flash the caret while the shift keys are down -- comment says something about benefit to Shift-Select.  It''s certainly a gross loss to Lispx typein.  ''Suggest that another kind of channel be used to coordinate between a window that enables shift-selections and caret suppression.  Probably just a refinement of the "kludge" test, such as looking further to see if the cursor is in a window that handles shift-selection; this refinement wouldn''t be run of course unless the shift keys (or copy key) were being held down.''-- JonL --''-----''From': masinter.pa'Date': 12-May-84  9':17':46 PDT'Subject': Re': AR  1024': PAREN MATCH FLASHER ISN''T WORKING'In-reply-to': JonL''s message of 11 May 84 23':14 PDT'To': JonL'cc': vanMelle, Masinter, Burton, LispSupport''I think I already improved the situation.''What happened was this': there used to be a kludge down in the lowest level of show.ccaret which was testing whether to flash the caret if the shift key was down AND THE CARET WAS (partially) OCCLUDED.''The idea was that if you were doing a shift-select, you didn''t want it to pop up the caret flashing window ''cause you were looking elsewhere.''Richard and I discussed this, and I moved the test up into caret.flash?, but unfortunately, it left out the test for occlusion.''Last pass, I put in the test': if shift is down AND one of the mouse buttons is down, but in fact, that''s all wrong.''Putting the test back down into \CARET.SHOW will require a little more work': it means that \CARET.SHOW needs to take a flag which enables testing for shift-down (since, if you are taking DOWN the caret, you don''t wanna test), and it will need to return an indication of whether it really DID show the caret, and CARET.FLASH will need to pass the flag down and deal with the conditional result.''I''ll try to get to this soon.''Larry''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 12':43':49Attn: Assigned To: Masinter.paIn/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
