The next day I pulled up the same document and made some changes (but not to the tabs) and made a hardcopy. To my dismay the tabs had moved.

There were no tab arrows.''Mimi'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 19':46':11Attn: Assigned To: sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
