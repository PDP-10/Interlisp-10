Ron has apparently made some changes to the FONTDESCRIPTOR record.  My BQUOTE package must redefine all the in core GACHA fonts in order to get a visible backquote character in GACHA.  For this purpose, BQUOTE includes 6 FONTDESCRIPTOR UGLYVARS.  Loading BQUOTE into the latest sysouts causes lisp to crash because the UGLYVARS somehow redefine the FONTDESCRIPTOR record (rather than failing and breaking which I think would be saner).  BQUOTE wouldn''t need these UGLYVARS if LISPCORE^ would stop dragging its heals on AR#27, my request that the backquote character be put into GACHA fonts.  It''s a bit frustrating to know that 3 COPYFILEs could accomplish in 2 minutes what over a year of bureaucratic self-excusing has not.        Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 18-Sep-84 12':21':58
