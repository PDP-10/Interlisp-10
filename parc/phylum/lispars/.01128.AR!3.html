Number: 1128Date: 18-May-84 12':29':49Submitter: vanMelleSource: BurtonSubject: RAID call "Can''t build frame for process call" in \PROCESS.MAKEFRAMELisp Version: Description: 'Got this Raid call under a PROCESS.APPLY in tedit.''Diagnosis': Two applications of \MISCAPPLY* are stepping on each other under a very infrequent circumstance.  The one in \PROCESS.MAKEFRAME does a CONS midway through, which, if a new cons page needs to be allocated, causes a call to \NEWPAGE, which uses the Misc context to do \DONEWPAGE.  Fix is to move the CONS to a safer place.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 11':49':25Attn: Assigned To: vanMelleIn/By: Disposition: [bvm fixed on 6/21/84]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: ProcessesMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: OnceImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
