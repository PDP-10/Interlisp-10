This is really annoying since one then has to rescroll down to the previous context.  I can''t figure out the conditions under which this happens, but it happens relatively frequently.''Frank''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sheil.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
