If I can''t get to a namespace server, I get a break window':  unknown host.''If it can''t find the host it should cdr down the list to the next host.  Then current bahavior is not useful in an environment where hosts are looked up in the namespace.''I guess it should be switch-controlled to avoid the obvious screws.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 30-May-84 15':31':41Attn: Kapl, SybalAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: PrintingMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
