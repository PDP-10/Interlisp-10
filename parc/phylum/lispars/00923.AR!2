Hence, there are two new functions in the ATTACHEDWINDOW package (see below).  These will be in the next loadup.  Tedit and Lafite will soon be converted to use them.  Updated documentation on <LispCore>Library>Attachedwindow.press.''''(GETPROMPTWINDOW MAINWINDOW #LINES FONT)'Returns the attached prompt window associated with MAINWINDOW, creating it if necessary.  The window is always attached to the top of MAINWINDOW, has DSPSCROLL set to T, and has a PAGEFULLFN of NILL to inhibit page holding.  The window is at least #LINES lines high (default 1); if a pre-existing window is shorter than that, it is reshaped to make it large enough.  FONT is the font to give the prompt window (defaults to the font of MAINWINDOW), and applies only when the window is first created.'(REMOVEPROMPTWINDOW MAINWINDOW)'Detaches the attached prompt window, if any, associated with MAINWINDOW, and closes it.'''There are some glitches in this; notably, if the prompt window is not the topmost window of an attachedwindow group and you ask for a bigger prompt window.  But I thought it important to get people the interface and worry later about exceptional behavior that attachedwindow has never handled very well.''	BillWorkaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 13':19':06Attn: Assigned To: vanMelle.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
