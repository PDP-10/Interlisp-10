My guess is that 50% of my typos are of this form.  In my own environment, I''ve added a DWIMUPCASE function to DWIMUSERFORMS that will correct typed-in atoms if they have a binding.  I''ve also added an "ok" LISPXMACRO to handle my most frequently mistyped word.''--Tom''-----''Date': 13 SEP 84 00':16 PDT'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': ar#2136, DWIM should uppercase variables'To':   LispSupport'cc':   Dietterich, masinter''I have fixed this and the (only slightly related) other problem reported in the same AR (about OK not being a candidate for spelling correction)':''DWIM as a special case when looking for variables will try the upper-case version of an atom even if it is not on the spelling list (this was true for functions)''I also fixed it so that OK was on the spelling list of LISPX commands.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 13-Sep-84 09':51':58</pre>
