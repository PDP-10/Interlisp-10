Number: 1395Date: 12-Jun-84 16':15':57Submitter: le.pasaSource: Roger Beeman, BoeingSubject: COLOR bugsLisp Version: Fugue4/Fugue6Description: ' 1.  X3, and 3mb microcode crashed system on (LOGOUT) because user is not told  in the documentation to set (DISPLAYOFF T).''2.  LOADED COLOR.DCOM and called (COLORDEMO).  COLORMAPCREATE broke (called by COLORMAPOF) .  Inspect code of COLORDISPLAY and find that LastSystemColorMap is NOBIND and must be set to NIL.   Also, we had to set \STOPCOLOR to \DOLPHINSTOPCOLOR. ''3.  Called (WELL 5) and get break saying 16 (or 17 or 18) are Illegal arguments.  We did not try to go beyond 15 colors.  '-------''Date': 12 Jun 84 17':40 PDT'From': Sheil.pa'Subject': Request for documentation change'To': 1100support.pasa'cc': martino.pasa, lispsupport, vanmelle''During their visit Monday, Boeing asked why they could not run color on a Dolphin that had both sets of net ucode.''I found out that the two net ucode configuration was only released to support gateways and that it wasnt intended to support a normal workstation. Especially not color, which takes so much of the memory bandwidth that a gateway running color would be ghastly.''But they just wanted a workstation that lived on both nets and didnt understand why it didnt work. Turns out that it''s because there is no room.''When this was explained to them, they were only a little mollified and demanded to know why this limitation was not in the documentation (where it is explained that the floating point doesnt fit in this configuration). I calmed them down by saying that I''d get it included next release (of documentation).''I think this is Guide, rather than Lisp manual, documentation. If so, could whoever maintains this please respond indicating whether they are willing to make this minor change?''Beau''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: le.pasaEdit-Date: 18-Jun-84 11':24':41Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: ColorMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files: </pre>
