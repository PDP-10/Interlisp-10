As it stands, it isn''t worth putting in the AR database because it doesn''t provide any information that could be used to find the problem.''In general, it is very hard to diagnose problems unless we know the circumstances under which they occur.  You say that this problem occurs with FREQUENCY = Everytime.  Does this mean that every time they call DSPCREATE it goes into RAID?

I was a little hasty when I answered your letter before.  At the time, I did not believe that you REALLY meant that it fell into Raid every time you did (DSPCREATE <window>).  Such a low-level function couldn''t be that wedged!  (so I thought).  Therefore, since I thought that this problem occurred in some (unspecified) special situation, I asked for more information before submitting an AR.''I have now submitted this problem as AR 731': (DSPCREATE <window>) falls into Raid.''Note':  when I try (DSPCREATE (CREATEW)) on a dorado, it simply gives an appropriate error.  Does it only occur with 1108s?''-----''Date': 17 Apr 84 12':54 PST'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': AR 731': (DSPCREATE <window>) falls into Raid'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 17 Apr 84 12':39':07 PST (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa''This reported as an earlier AR 302 which is now fixed in the system that you are running in.

I have not tested it on a DLion or a Dorado.  I am using the April 10 version of Fugue.6.  I suppose it''s worth impressing that date on everybody''s conscious, since there are many different sysouts floating around purposrting to be Fugue.6.  The April 10 version is the March 30 sysout patched to reinstate floating point operations.
