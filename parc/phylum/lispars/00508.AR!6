The behavior is as follows':  ''1. User 1-boots into the bouncing white square and brings up install tool. ''2.  User Installs sysout from VAX onto a logical volume.''3. Just before the byte count is about to be incremented for the last time, the system hangs for about 3 minutes, then falls into 0915.''Note': it is sometimes possible to 1-boot, get into the Lisp Tool and START the volume anyway.  Question':  will the volume be startable even if the last few pages of the sysout were not transferred?  Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Apr-84 17':21':57Attn: JFung.pasaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: [tl':  superseded by AR 506 4/5/84]System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Installation UtilityMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: SupersededProblem Type: BugSource Files:
