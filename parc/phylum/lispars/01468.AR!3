According to the manual (p. 3.13), this is controlled by the "CLISP declarations in effect".  But all I can find about CLISP declarations is some cryptic remark  on page 16.13 about something to the effect of (CLISP (CLISP': FLOATING) ...)''Typing (CLISP (CLISP': FLOATING) (ADD X 0.5] seems to translate to (*DECLARATIONS': FLOATING) (ADD X 0.5) and does an integer add in any case.  Can what I want actually be done?  Thanks.''			- Michel'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 18':43':11Attn: DocumentationAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: DWIMMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
