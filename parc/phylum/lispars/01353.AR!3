FOO.DCOM is the value of LCFIL.  Setting that back to NIL (by calling COMPSET explicitly) solves the problem.  But it seems that (1) it is a bug that the variable LCFIL is global, and (2) a bug that the breakdown entry to the compiler gets confused by this global setting.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 17':11':10
