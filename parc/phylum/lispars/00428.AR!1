''1. There should be an example.'2. What are the units for TABS? '    Are the tab positions given in inches or points? '	a) If inches, why don''t you say so!'	b) If points, then what units does the marginbar use?'3. You say "This is a CONS pair" -- do you mean "dotted pair"?'	Since the second elt of the TABS list is always another '	list, why don''t you just say "This is a list, the CAR is '	a ....".  ''By the way, how do "point" map onto "screen distances"??  You should tell me what the coefficient is!  (e.g. 1 point = 2.3 pixels = .1 inch....  this is just a guess.)
