On the other hand, I have been mucking around with some of the generic i/o, so am suspicious of what I might have done.''	Bill''-----''FROM': MASINTER''if I say FINDCALLERS(FIXSPELL RECORD) in the latest loadup, it returns without finding anything, but if I MOVD(FILEPOS FFILEPOS), it works.''-------'Date':  8 Jun 84 22':47 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''The problem seems to be that you remade IOCHAR from a system on Maxc that had the old definition of GLOBALRESOURCES in it.  I remade it again to get the appropriate initializations expressions onto the file (\\FFDELTA1.GLOBALRESOURCE instead of \FFDELTA1, etc).  I think you can LOADFROM(IOCHAR.DCOM) to get your FFILEPOS working again.  Or wait for the next loadup.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84  9':58':20Attn: Assigned To: vanMelleIn/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
