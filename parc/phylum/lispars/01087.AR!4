CPM files do not have version numbers.  I find it necessary to specifically include a sought after extension to get any answer back at all.  Thus,'     DIR {FLOPPY}*'     DIR {FLOPPY}*.*'     DIR {FLOPPY}CROCK.*'do not work while'     DIR {FLOPPY}*.TTY'     DIR {FLOPPY}CROCK.TTY'do work.  The GENERATEFILES function for the CPM FLOPPY file device ignores the pattern arg being passed to it, punting all filtering to the caller.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':12':30Attn: Assigned To: vanMelleIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: [bvm fixed 5/14/84]System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 3071File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
