The check in \DFSInit is a temporary integrity check to make sure that I got all that stuff right.  So the solution is for you to take the \DFSInit call out of your init file altogether.  ''But it occurs to me that it might be your call to VOLUMEDISPLAY which is running \DFSInit.  Do you think that VOLUMEDISPLAY, MKDIR, etc. ought to continue gracefully or cause an error on a non-1108?  I would think they ought to cause an error (with the possible exception of VOLUMEDISPLAY).''-- Tayloe.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: stansburyEdit-Date:  5-Sep-84 20':01':40
