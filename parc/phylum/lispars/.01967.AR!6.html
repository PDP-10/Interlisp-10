But currently, I have some mundane'concerns about using {DSK} , {SAFE} our VAX with 4.2 unix file server,'and {sumex}tops-20 with the same files.  First of all fugue6 seems'to write out a different end-of-line character than older lisps.'I haven''t thought about this much, but it seems it now is supposed'to write out a CR and LF?  There are several problems I have now'experienced ':''(1) see and ty no longer pretty print the files I save so it''s a'mess to read.''(2) I usually make my files to SAFE, but sometimes it''s down, and'I save to DSK or SUMEX. Well, it seems that I have had the 'experience that files don''t always get printed correctly. For'instance, today I did a makefile to dsk with a copy of the old'version on dsk (though the filedates may have pointed to safe) and'I didn''t use the NEW option and when I picked up the raven'copy the body of the defintions were not there because they ran off'the line as ifit was one big line.  This has happened on other'occassions and Christopher Schmidt has not been able to completely'explain what is happening.  ''From': Masinter'Date 27 Aug 84'Subject': AR#1967, incompatible EOL conventions don''t work with MAKEFILE-remake'To': Richer@sumex'cc': 1100Support, LispSupport''I''ve extracted AR#1967 from your message of 14 Jun 84 on "with regard to distributed files". (Unfortunately, when several problems get sent in the same message, the later problems tend to get lost in the noise.)''If you didn''t get a response': Unix hosts want LF, Tops-20 wants CRLF, and IFS and {DSK} and {FLOPPY} and most other devices want CR. This is settable with the EOL file property, GETFILEINFO(file EOL), SETFILEINFO(file EOL mode) and OPENFILE(file OUTPUT OLD NIL ((EOL mode)))''There is a problem I imagine with MAKEFILE-remake calling COPYBYTES of the old def to the new when you loadfrom one EOL convention and MAKEFILE on another.''----''Larry seems to have fixed this, by putting COPYCHARS instead of COPYBYTES in pRETTYPRINT2.  I marked it as fixed.  --Ron''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: KaplanEdit-Date: 15-Sep-84 03':47':40</pre>
