It''s useful when filling in the Substitute command, the Print command, and in filling out ARS.  I suppose that the NEXT key would either delete or select for deletion the text in the next field.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  5-Jun-84 11':45':21Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: T80 (80MB)Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
