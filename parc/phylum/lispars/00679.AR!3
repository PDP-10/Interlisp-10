I have not looked at them closely though.''The window creating I was doing was with SHOWGRAPH (from GRAPHER). As I remember it, this was the only windowing I was doing (aside from Dedits and Lafite). I''m not completely sure that this is what caused it . If I run into it again, I will try to pay more attention to what I had been doing.''By the way, what I am doing is writing some tools to help make the Lisp Library and Lispusers floppies we send to customers. The idea is to have all files that depend on one another on the same floppy i.e. BROWSER loads GRAPHER and GRAPHER loads SMALLFONTS, these should all be on the same floppy. Part of what I''m doing is graphing these dependencies as a tree structure as an easy way to see what is going on.''Jim''     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----''As far as we can determine, nothing in the grapher is holding on to windows.  Rather, the window holds onto the graph.  I''ve marked this declined, barring any new and clear examples that it is indeed the grapher that is at fault.  Note that in older versions of the grapher, the graph itself could be holding onto alot of space, since a bitmap was being created for each node.  This is not true in the new grapher.''Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: KaplanEdit-Date:  5-Sep-84 09':53':40
