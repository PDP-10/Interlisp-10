Number: 132Date: 17-Mar-84  0':23':36Submitter: Masinter.PASource: Subject: performance &amp; integration of FXPRINTERLisp Version: Fugue.6Description: 'FXPRINTER currently doesn''t follow the same conventions as the PRINTER package. It also is still quite clunky. We should compare its operations vs. the PRINTER package and fix the inconsistencies (it should make LISTFILES and HardcopyW work properly on the printer.)''FXPRINTER should also default reasonably to 9600 baud, init RS232, etc.''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 11':16 PST'From': Barrera.pasa'Subject': New version of FXPRINTER'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Barrera.pasa''A new version of the FXPRINTER package has been moved to {PHYLUM}&lt;LISPCORE&gt;LIBRARY&gt; along with updated documentation.  The Epson FX80 desk-top printer may now also be used as the default printing host.
