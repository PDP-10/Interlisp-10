I came in this morning to find 305 msgs on my server.  Lafite''s still getting them (i think) after 20 minutes, and i''d feel a lot better if  (a) i had some indication that Lafite wasn''t lost or fallen asleep, and (b) i had some clue how much longer i was going to be waiting.  This could be readily accomplished by simply having Lafite continuously display how many msgs it''s retrieved so far.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 19-Jun-84 14':44':57Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 3071File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
