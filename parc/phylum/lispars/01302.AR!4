(In fact, it is so slow as to make it useless for many large file manipulation tasks).''I would estimate Lisp COPYFILE is 5 times slower than an identical file copy using FTP in the Alto exec.''Why is this??  One thing I''ve noticed is that COPYFILE (via COPYBYTES) uses Leaf.  Seems for copying large files that FTP protocol might be much more efficient.''''Frank''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 10':09':19Attn: Assigned To: vanMelleIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Generic File OperationsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files:
