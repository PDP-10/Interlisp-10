This seems to have started happening after I did MKDIR to get a local DLion {DSK} device.  Unfortunately, setting NLSETQGAG and using RETRY I still couldn''t make the error go into a break.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 18-Jun-84 14':08':06Attn: StansburyAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: OtherMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
