He had a situation where he could not logout because RS232MODEMCONTROL was breaking under LOGOUT with Timeout waiting for TTYPort.''I told him to return NIL from the Break and that seemed to work.  I do not know if he could return to that partition.  But he did successfully use RS232Chat from another partition while I was talking to him, so I do not think the problem was with the 8085 getting wedged.''I think he was running the latest release.''Thu, Could you submit an AR to JonL on this?  thanks.''Rick'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 12':07':17Attn: Assigned To: JonLIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: I''m fixing the &lt;LispCore&gt;Library&gt; version of RS232 to ignore timeouts when trying to logout.  Still, this does not explain how Ed Payne managed to get into the situation where timeouts occured.  -- JonL 12-Jun-84System: CommunicationsSubsystem: RS232Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: OnceImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
