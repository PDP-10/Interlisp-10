Then I selected the few lines in question.  Then I hit APPLY.  ''What happened?  The whole document of about 10 pages got indented.  ''Wondering if I had indeed failed to select properly,  I  hit  CENTER, then carefully re-selected the lines in question,  hit APPLY, and IT centered the whole text.  What''s more, the ruler disappeared.   I tried to get it back by scrolling and REDISPLAY, but the entire exp. menu had been cleared, leaving the empty menu window.  This raised another question':''Without the CLOSEMENU button, can I close JUST the menu?  (selecting EXP MENU in the TEdit menu didn''t get a new one)''And finally, how do I get the text back the way it was before without access to the expanded menu????''Carol K.''[JDS':  This is one for JIR.
