Number: 1583Date:  2-Jul-84 12':56':37Submitter: Kaplan.paSource: Kaplan.paSubject: TEDIT font glitchesAssigned To: Attn: Sybalsky, NuyensStatus: WishIn/By: Problem Type: Impact: ModerateDifficulty: Frequency: EverytimePriority: HopefullySystem: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1132Disk: Lisp Version: 30-Jun-84 23':54':14Source Files: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Disposition: Description: The interaction using the Other font-family button is clumsy.  You choose Other, then hit APPLY, then it asks you to tell it what other is.  When you tell it, it doesn''t seem to remember that anymore, at least not in the menu, so you have to go thru this clumsiness again.''Suggestion':  that Other be followed with brackets to fill, such that when you edit in there, you get to define the new font name.  And the first time you apply that, it pops up as a separate item in the family menu, which might then go onto 2 or more lines.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: sybalskyEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 16':52':39</pre>
