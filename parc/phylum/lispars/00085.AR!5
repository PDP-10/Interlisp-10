The hardware'people say no, and talked to someone (Marty Raime?) in Pasa.'who said it was software, so...).''The high-level goal is to copy a floppy, say one of the lisp-library'disks. to do this I load all the files on to the hard disk and then'load them back down to a second floppy.''................................................................''I then edit COPYTODSK to make it a prog, ie.  ''  (PROG NIL (PROG NIL (COPYFILE (QUOTE {FLOPPY}FILE1.;1)'				(QUOTE {DSK}FILE1.;1))	'		      (PRINT 1))'	    (PROG NIL (COPYFILE (QUOTE {FLOPPY}FILE2.;1)'				       (QUOTE {DSK}FILE2.;1))'		      (PRINT 2))'     etc.''(EVAL COPYTODSK)''and flashing 513 sometimes. I cannot get it to break after any'particular file, sometimes it stops after printing 4 or 11 or even makes it'all the way through.''If this succeeds, I remove the source disk put in the destination disk and'I then make a prog to go back to another floppy using the same'steps, getting something that looks like':''  (PROG NIL (PROG NIL (COPYFILE (QUOTE {DSK}FILE1.;1)'				(QUOTE {FLOPPY}FILE1.;1))	'		      (PRINT 1))'	    (PROG NIL (COPYFILE (QUOTE {DSK}FILE2.;1)'				(QUOTE {FLOPPY}FILE2.;1))'		      (PRINT 2))'     etc.''this prog succeeds 1 in 20 times, which I consider repeatable,'though it doesn''t freeze after the same file.''Summary':'=======''1) When I copy a large number of files from floppy to hard disk I get'   flashing 513 some substantial % of the time (30-40).''2) When I copy a large number of files from hard disk to floppy I almost'   always get flashing 513.''3) This only happens on one machine, which has had its floppy drive'   replaced and its CP(?) board swapped without making any difference.''These progs succeed in copying files on our other 1108. I hope this'is helpful. I am sorry this is so baroque, but I really haven''t'thought hard on how to call the editor from a function and do the'editor steps I now do by hand.''"kill ''dem micro bugs"''thanks.'                    Mark Rosenstein''-----''Date': 20 MAR 84 17':30 PST'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': AR 85'To':   LISPSUPPORT'cc':   ROACH''     ATTN should be 1100SUPPORT or RAIM.
