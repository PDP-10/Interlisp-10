I did it by implementing a menu called BackgroundCopyMenu which is called up when a button is pressed in the background and a copy key is down (parallel to BackgroundMenu).  {this is actually the default BACKGROUNDCOPYRIGHTBUTTONFN so people can change that too.}  The list of items starts out NIL but gets the addition of SNAP when IMAGEOBJ is loaded.  It means incompatibility for those people who like to window command while holding down a shift key but I think that''s a small group.'''You can try it out when TEdit gets its copyinsertfn going.''richard''-----''Date': 20 Jul 84 14':38 PDT'From': sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': COPYINSERT a SNAP'In-reply-to': Burton.pa''s message of 16 Jul 84 20':04 PDT'To': Burton.pa'cc': Kaplan.pa, TEditSupport.pa''I''ve put a COPTINSERTFN into TEdit, and it''ll be in the next release.'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 13':39':39Attn: Assigned To: Burton.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
