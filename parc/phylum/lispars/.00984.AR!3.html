The only activity I could get from the mouse was the aforementioned ARG NOT SELECTION error.  I finally chose to SUBMIT the ar, which broke with ILLEGAL ARG NIL in (TEXTOBJ NIL) in (AR.FIND.BUTTON NIL ''System':) in AR.GET.ASSOCIATED.MENU.VAL (W = NIL) in AR.CHECK.SUBMENU in AR.CHECK.FIELDS in AR.FORM.MENU.ACTIONFN.''For obvious reasons, I am submitting this bug report via Lafite.''-----'5/4/84 mjs'Subject': AR QQQ': Submitting from AR.FORM bombs in (AR.FIND.BUTTON NIL ''System':)'In-reply-to': vanMelle''s message of 2 May 84 21':34 PDT'To': vanMelle'cc': TEditSupport, Sannella''I can''t think of what could be happening  --- it is very strange that it could have gotten that far without bombing.
