Of course, these files COULD be loaded during the MAKEINIT, but that would be too slow.''Ideally, MAKEINIT should be modified to take a LOADUPDIRECTORIES argument, so it would use MKI.RPAQQ to assign the atom LOADUPDIRECTORIES to the right value.  The call to MAKEINIT is in the .cm, so that is where the directories could be specified.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files:
