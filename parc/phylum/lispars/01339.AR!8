I think that a break should happen when the gc is turned off, so that the user (a) has some inkling of a problem, and (b) can do something about it while there is still time.  (Just doing nothing with the GC turned off can eventually use up all available space, it seems)Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Masinter.PAEdit-Date:  7-Jun-84 14':33':24Attn: MasinterAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Virtual MemoryMachine: 1132Disk: Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
