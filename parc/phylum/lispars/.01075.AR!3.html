If I run &lt;LispCore&gt;Next&gt;FULL.SYSOUT without ''greeting'' (by deleting INIT.LISP from {DSK} and typing &lt;return&gt; at the prompt), and then load in {Phylum}&lt;LispCore&gt;Library&gt;LOGOCLOCK.DCOM, it breaks with a ARG NOT PILOTBBT, NOBIND error. ''I find that the problem is that the call to \GETBRUSHBBT has a BBT argument of NOBIND. By the time I get into it, \\BRUSHBBT.GLOBALRESOURCE is NIL.''I don''t know exactly what is going on here, but I assume this is a problem with the new global resource stuff. This is quite reproducable, so see me if you have trouble getting it going.''-----''Date':  9 May 84 13':46 PDT'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': global resource \\BRUSHBBT.GLOBALRESOURCE broken'In-reply-to': Masinter.pa''s message of 9 May 84 13':08 PDT'To': JonL.pa'cc': Masinter.pa, LispSupport.pa''JonL,''Could be that we missed recompiling something thru a conspiracy of macros.  First thought is to try BCOMPLing ADISPLAY, which can then be loaded up in the current loadup to see if it that fixes the problem.''Next thought is that there was some non-standard useage in ADISPLAY that our first findcallers missed (e.g. a RESOURCECONTEXT).  If that is the case, the fix is to simply extract from the RESOURCECONTEXT form.''Unfortunately, I have to leave now and won''t be in again at least until tomorrow morning, and maybe not until tomorrow night.''--Ron  ''-----'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84  9':51':52Attn: Assigned To: JonlIn/By: Disposition: Richard had edited ADISPLAY on 8-May-84 without haveing a current version of EXPORTS.ALL; result was that the globalresources defined on the file were output into the recompiled .dcom file with the old version  the globalresource facility.  I merely remade and recompiled ADISPLAY.  -- JonL 11-May-84.System: Operating SystemSubsystem: OtherMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
