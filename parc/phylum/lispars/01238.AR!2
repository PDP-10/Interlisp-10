I log out and boot lispon Part2.  I do a MKDIR on Part2, log out and then I boot lisp on Part1 once more.  When I do a DIR {DSK} on Part1 there is mention of the files I created on this partition BEFORE I did the MKDIR on Part2.  Conclusion': Too much information about the local filesystem is being kept around after logout. Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 12':43':12Attn: Assigned To: StansburyIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: 1108Disk: Q2040 (43MB)Microcode Version: 5124Memory Size: 8191File Server: IFSServer Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: OnceImpact: SeriousPriority: HopefullyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files:
