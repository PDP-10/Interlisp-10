Most windows including the exec window do not.  TEDIT does right buttoning in the main window is considered a selection.  I tried right buttoning in the title (where the window command menu comes up) and it didn''t activate.  I don''t know whether or not Tedit can/should/will change this.  I changed the attn to Sybalsky.''This didn''t say which system he was running in but this may have changed since Carol so you may want to see if he still isn''t happy with Harmony.''Richard''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: burton.paEdit-Date: 28-Aug-84 18':50':40
