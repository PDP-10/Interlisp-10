Fixed.  All user-entry functions to the dlion file system will cause an error ("You can''t run this function if you aren''t on an 1108") instead of a raid call if run on a machine on which they are meaningless.  CURRENTVOLUME in particular will probably be decomissioned in favor of DISKPARTITION, which does the same thing.   -- Tayloe.'["stansbury" " 5-Sep-84 19':56':58" Assigned% To': Attn': Status':(Open->Fixed) Disposition':]Description: 'Date':  4 Aug 84 17':26 PDT'From': halvorsen.pa'Subject': Lisp': (CURRENTVOLUME) on Dorado puts you in RAID'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': halvorsen.pa''Lisp System Date': Latest <lispcore>next>lisp.sysout'Machine': Dorado  'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 5777'Frequency': Always'Impact': Serious''That''s it.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: stansburyEdit-Date:  5-Sep-84 19':57':00
