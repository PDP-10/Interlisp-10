I think we are now in a position to make some modifications to suit our needs.''The desire of course is to get a version of Hello that could install from floppy, PUP or NS host, and would also take a script. If we had that, it would solve most of our installation needs. People could use the script if they wanted, or change it around, e.g., if they wanted to partition their disk a different way.''Do you have a list of "wishes" for Prometheus? ''I think, for example, that it would be resonable to add a "Install Lisp Sysout" command that would know how many floppies were to come, might take variations in the floppy name, and would extend the virtual memory appropriately. ''I don''t know what else is desired.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:
