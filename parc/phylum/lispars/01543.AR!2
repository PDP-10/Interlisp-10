The Lafite problem arises because you changed Tedit''s exit routine to clear the prompt window.  Unfortunately, in this case, the prompt window has already been detached and closed.  How about you only clear the window if it''s OPENWP?''	Bill'-----''Date': 25 Jun 84 16':13 PDT'From': masinter.pa'Subject': Lisp': Closing stupid Lafite envelope icons causes wide short window to appear'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': vanMelle, TEditSupport''Lisp System Date': 19-Jun-84 14':48':49'Machine': Dandelion (Purcell)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 17777'Frequency': Always'Impact': Annoying''When I close the little Icons that Lafite creates (which I don''t like), I get an extra wide bar across my screen.''-----''Date': 25 Jun 84 16':28 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Closing stupid Lafite envelope icons causes wide short window to appear'In-reply-to': masinter.pa''s message of 25 Jun 84 16':13 PDT'In-reply-to': Acuff.pa''s message of 25 Jun 84 13':45 PDT'In-reply-to': Stansbury''s message of 20 Jun 84 16':15 PDT'In-reply-to': Dietterich.pa''s message of 20 Jun 84 11':47 PDT'In-reply-to': Kaplan.pa''s message of 19 Jun 84 16':28 PDT'To': masinter.pa, Acuff.pa, Stansbury, Dietterich.pa, Kaplan.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa, TEditSupport.pa''The problem was introduced in the most recent Tedit, wherein the Tedit exit routines clear the window''s prompt window.
