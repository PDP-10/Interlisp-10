I currently have six of these, all but one of which are formatted correctly.  The problem case is the folder name {ROSEBOWL}<BIRD>STAFF where the last character should be printed on the third line but isn''t.  Shorter and longer names work OK.''-------'Date': 31 Jul 84 18':45 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR#1706': Lafite Browser Icon has file name formatted incorrectly'To': Sybalsky'cc': vanMelle.pa''This looks like it''s yours':''(TITLEDICONW MSGFOLDERTEMPLATE "{ROSEBOWL}<BIRD>STAFF")''drops the final F.
