Two ways in which this screwed me recently':''MOVE-WINDOWS': I can''t look at its filecoms without doing (EVAL ''MOVE-WINDOWSCOMS) because the filename gets treated as CLISP. [lmm - I think this is bogus and could not reproduce]''(FILESLOAD WINDOW).  Window is a file I created.  I have to do (LOAD ''{PHYLUM}<WALLACE>EMACS>WINDOW) because there''s already some file called WINDOW ({eris}<lispcore>sources>window) loaded into the sysout. Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84 14':15':36
