I am not sure that everyone who uses IMNAME would want this.  Also, if significant numbers of people ever use it for non-Interlisp-Manual files, there needs to be a way to specify what hashfile to use.''Why don''t you just bring it up in your init file?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-May-84 16':44':28Attn: Sannella.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: DocumentationSubsystem: ToolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
