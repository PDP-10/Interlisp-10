This seems to break CLOSEF (actually, OLDCLOSEF) with the following error':''ARG NOT IMAGEOPS'{**DEALLOC**}#1,73740 ''This error is both persistent --- always the same deallocated object, and always traceable to the same source': the IMAGEOPS field of a stream.   ''When EXPORTS.ALL was loaded, it did indicate that IMAGEOPS was redefined.''John Sybalsky was running the same sysout, also with EXPORTS.ALL loaded --- only indirectly through {phylum}&lt;lispcore&gt;sources&gt;abc. I load EXPORTS.ALL directly because I don''t want the rest of the stuff.  From looking at ABC, I can''t see why it should matter.  Help!' '---Jim    ''------''Date': 29 MAR 84 20':52 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': Re': Lisp': EXPORTS.ALL problems'To':   desRivieres, LispSupport'cc':   JONL''In response to the message sent  28 Mar 84 18':21 PST from desRivieres.pa''Since you used the sysout from &lt;LispCore&gt;, you should use the EXPORTS.ALL'from &lt;LispCore&gt; also.  The usual procedure for "loading ABC" is to CONN'to {Phylum}&lt;LispCore&gt;Sources&gt; and then just (LOAD ''ABC), which by directory'searching will find the EXPORTS.ALL  either from &lt;LispCore&gt;Sources&gt; or from'&lt;LispSources&gt;.''I notice that the &lt;Lisp&gt;Library&gt; version is about 1 month older than the'"release" sysout -- shouldn''t it be updated now to at least correspond with'the Feb 26 version?''-----''Date':  2 Apr 84 12':06 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': AR 369': EXPORTS.ALL won''t load'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 29 Mar 84 12':47':44 PST (Thursday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Sybalsky.pa''Not me, baby.
