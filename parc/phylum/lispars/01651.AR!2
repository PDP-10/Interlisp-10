In general, any white space in the (A B C) list for which the (A B C D) list contains an element will not be properly erased.  If you have the lists ((A B C) (DE FG HI)) and you select the first element, then  the second, and then issue Switch, the display looks like (AEBFC))I instead of (A B C)).''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Jul-84 12':09':13Attn: Assigned To: In/By: AR 818Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: SupersededProblem Type: BugSource Files:
