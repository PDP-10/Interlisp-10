This is an entirely unreasonable restriction.GETFILEINFO returns the FILETYPE correctly and allows you to determine which files are lisp, office systems, 820etc.  But an attempt to do a SETFILEINFO on FILE.TYPE results in "Unknown filing attribute".  This means that it is not possible to move files from the LISP world to that of other networked devices which emplay specific filetypes, speciofically this preventing one customer from moving files from lisp to an 820.''Martin'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Wogulis.pasaEdit-Date: 29-Aug-84 09':02':56
