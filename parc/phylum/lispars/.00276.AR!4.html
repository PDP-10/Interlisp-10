When the floppy is reading, why can''t it look at the disk and figure out what kind of mode it has.  And if the mode is wrong, why is it that it can get at the directory without any problem?''It also seems reasonable to me to have the floppy revert to its base mode (PILOT) after it has finished writing a sysout and the disk has been removed and replaced.''--RON''P.S.  You might want to inform 1100 support about the cause of this LP error; perhaps it should be noted in the release message as a known problem with this release.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-Apr-84 13':47':43Attn: Assigned To: RoachIn/By: AR 217Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion FloppyMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: PerhapsStatus: SupersededProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
