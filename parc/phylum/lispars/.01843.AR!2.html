See also AR 1440 for extensive discussion of the topic.'["JonL.pa" " 4-Sep-84 21':56':12" Assigned% To': Attn': Status':(Open-&gt;Fixed) Disposition':]Description: 'mjs':  dammit, there MUST be some reason besides the fact that it was introduced after all of the packages were loaded.

There''s no damn reason at all why FULL.sysout shouldn''t have FOO already existing -- its the difference between an ATOMHASH#PROBES of about 50 and one of about 200 *** for the most common meta variable that we all use ***.    More importantly, it costs 15-30 seconds of page swapping every 5 minutes or so of debugging.''PLEASE PUT IT BACK ASAP.''-- JonL --'''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JonL.paEdit-Date:  4-Sep-84 21':56':12</pre>
