Perhaps error messages should only be printed when the mail is undeliverable or when some wizard-mode flg is set?''-----''Date': 26 Mar 84 09':54 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': Host error Messages'In-reply-to': Wallace.pa''s message of 26 Mar 84 05':17 PST'To': Wallace.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa''Indeed.  The message you saw came as a result of a change to the BSP protocol handler to make it more informative about why a connection attempt failed.  This was generally a good thing in the case of Chat and Ftp.  Unfortunately, in Lafite''s case, the program itself is quite willing to recover from a connection failure, so it would rather suppress the message, at least until it gives up.  Is on my list to fix.''	Bill'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Apr-84 12':18':23Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: '[Date':  9 Apr 84 12':38 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'AR 429': Diff  Moderate]System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
