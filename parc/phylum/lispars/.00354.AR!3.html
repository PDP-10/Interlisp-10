Number: 354Date: 28-Mar-84 18':40':50Submitter: masinter.PASource: desRivieres.PASubject: add manual index for KEYBOARD, etc.Lisp Version: Description: the manual description of modifying key actions doesn''t talk about MODIFY.KEYACTION or KEYACTION, and doesn''t say how to change the function of the Dandelion keyboard in any easy-to-find out way. The discussion that is there doesn''t mention what the names of the keys are.''[mjs 4/2/84':  what is this talking about.  What "manual description of modifying key actions"?  MODIFY.KEYACTION or KEYACTION are documented in the manual in a perfectly reasonable place.]''-----''Date':  2 Apr 84 12':02 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Lisp': AR 354 isn''t mine'To': LispSupport.pa'Lisp-System-Date': 29-Mar-84 17':34':40'Machine-Type': Dandelion''Bill Van Melle, maybe.  I don''t run the keyboard code, so I can''t very well document it.''-----''Date':  9 Apr 84 09':12 PST'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': AR#354'To': LispSupport''MODIFY.KEYACTION isn''t indexed. Maybe that''s the problem? Also, the index contains no references for KEYBOARD, etc. or at least, the IM inspector doesn''t know about them.''I don''t know who this belongs to, as I think the appropriate action is to index MODIFY.KEYACTION and regenerate the IM inspectors.''I guess this is Attn': Sannella, no? I don''t want it any more.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 10-Apr-84 11':48':03Attn: SannellaAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: KeyboardMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
