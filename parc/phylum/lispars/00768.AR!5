''This isn''t meant as a long-term solution, but allows one to work long enough with CAR/CDRERR set on to get some work done.''Once we can survive long enough with this flag set on, we can track down the more frequent errors too.''OVERFLOW(T) is reportedly working reasonably lately, btw.''-----''Date': 24 Jun 84 20':38 PDT'From': JonL.pa'Subject': [Acuff.pa': Re': CAR/CDRERR]'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': JonL.pa, Masinter.pa''I thought there was an AR for this one; if there is, I should also be attn''d.
