All other TEDIT functions for which a TEXTOBJ or a STREAM arg might make sense take the STREAM route.  Since TEXTOBJ''s are accessible from their textstreams, why not change the above way of doing business to'        (TEDIT.INCLUDE STREAM FILE START END)'					Kelly''-----''Date':  3 Apr 84 14':55 PST'From': sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': AR 407': TEDIT.INCLUDE should take STREAM arg instead of TEXTOBJ'In-reply-to': LispSupport.pa''s message of 31 Mar 84 13':36':21 PST (Saturday)'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Sybalsky.PA, Nuyens.PA''TEDIT.INCLUDE alkways would take a stream; I''ve changed the arglist.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 20-Jun-84 15':29':06Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
