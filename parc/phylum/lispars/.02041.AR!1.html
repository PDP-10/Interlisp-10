''2) add a TYPEPROP opcode -- this would take an alphabyte and simply return T or NIL depending on whether the logand of this byte and  the hibyte of the mds typetable entry is zero.  There are currently  only two bits used in this hibyte --- \TT.NOREF and \TT.LISPREF.  I would propose reserving one bit for object-oriented usage (meaning  that this type has a class structure behind it), and leaving the   others for subsets of various types; the reason for this is to enable tests like FIXP, NUMBERP, ATOM, etc, to compile into one  TYPEPROP instruction, instead of the long sequence that they now   produce.  Larry and I have briefly talked about this one in the   context of simplifying the compilation of numeric predicates, but it would be generally more applicable;  at the very least, we could  get away from explicit dependencies on the type number assignments  and depend only upon the contents of the mds type table entries.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: </pre>
