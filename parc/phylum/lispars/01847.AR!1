After you''ve TELERAIDed another machine, you can call''(V\CHECKARRAYSPACE), which runs the \CHECKARRAYSPACE function looking at the remote machines space.''This turns out to be so-so useful, but I think a little investment in TeleRaid tools would help us track down some of our microcode problems, etc.''I''m willing to guide folks in this arcane art, or take suggestions for what would be useful.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: Virtual MemoryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: FixedProblem Type: Source Files:
