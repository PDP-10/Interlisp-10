There was a plan at one point to automatically cache those files locally, either in {CORE} or {DSK}.  What is the status of that plan?  Is it likely to happen?  Is there any chance that the file server itself will support random access any time soon?''--Ron''-----''Date':  3 Apr 84 22':27 PST'From': stansbury.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Caching NS files locally'In-reply-to': Kaplan.pa''s message of 3 Apr 84 21':52 PST'To': Kaplan.pa'cc': Vanmelle.pa, Lispcore^.pa, Sheil''It is my understanding that random access is not supported in Services 8.0, which would mean that we would have to wait at least until the release of 9.0, which is probably too long.  Caching seems the only reasonable way to go.''Caching obviously presupposes a working dlion disk.  It is my hope that as soon as we get the dsk working reliably, someone (Bill?) will implement automatic caching.'''-- Tayloe.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 12-Jul-84 14':58':59
