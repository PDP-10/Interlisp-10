Number: 300Date: 26-Mar-84 15':16':45Submitter: Sannella.PASource: MASINTER.PASubject: Document Stack Overflow behaviorLisp Version: Description: 'Date': 24 MAR 84 18':36 PST'From': MASINTER.PA'Subject': document STACK OVERFLOW behavior'To':   lispsupport''In Interlisp-D (and in Interlisp-10), there is a fixed amount of space left for stack. When this space is exhausted, the STACK OVERFLOW error is caused. However, if the system waited until the stack were REALLY exhausted, there wouldn''t be room to run a break . Thus, there is a "buffer" which is reserved; when the stack intrudes into the buffer, it causes a stack-overflow interrupt and subsequently a break.''Once the buffer is allocated, it is allocated; the NEXT time a stack overflow happens, it is necessary to do a "hard" reset. The hard-reset reallocaes the buffer so tht there is once again room to get an error.''The effect of all of this is that STACK OVERFLOW causes a break every other time, unless you explicitly do a'(HARDRESET) in Interlisp-D (or a RESET in Interlisp-10).''[AR to fix this so that stack is growable and size controlable; very hard]''-----''Date': 13 Apr 84 11':45 PST'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': ARs'To': LispSupport'....''AR#300': This really was meant as a DOCUMENTATION AR, to at least document the current behavior. If you want to take the wish ''make stack grow dynamically'', that one is near Impossible, and thus will be Declined.  Rather than do that, lets just make this one be ''Document Stack Overflow behavior'' and change the Problem Type to be ''Documentation''. Priority': Hopefully. As with most of these Documentation jobs, I don''t exactly know who to assign them to. The info is in the message, nearly, and it just needs to be integrated in with the text of the manual.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 13-Jul-84 17':46':34Attn: DocumentationAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: Stack and InterpreterMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
