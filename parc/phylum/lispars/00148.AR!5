Calling PLAYTUNE on an ordinary Dolphin or Dorado just hangs.''Have you redefined PLAYTUNE?  If so, and we changed the system PLAYTUNE to be a no-op on non-Dandelions, then Lafite could go ahead and call it without checking your machine type first.''	Bill''-----''Date': 20 Mar 84 12':25 EST'From': Denber.wbst'Subject': Re': Lafite': NEWMAILTUNE'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 19 Mar 84 12':50 PST'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa''Ah - I deduce from your answer that Lafite refuses to call PLAYTUNE unless it''s running on a Dandelion?  I didn''t even change that much - I just redefined BEEPON and BEEPOFF.  I thought PLAYTUNE already was a NOP on D0''s.''			- Michel'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date:  2-May-84 16':33':32Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: MinorPriority: PerhapsStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
