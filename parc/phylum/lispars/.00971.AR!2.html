Since COPYBYTES/COPYCHARS doesn''t allow this, he goes thru an intermediate file--but can''t afford to keep that file around for the life of the session.  Hence, he wants TEdit to work right.  I''m standing in line behind COPYBYTES and decline to patch around it.]Description: 'Date': 24 Apr 84 22':59 PST'From': Halasz.pa'Subject': TEdit': TEDIT.PUT.PCTB needs don''t update old PCTB flag'To': TEditSupport.pa'cc': Halasz.pa''TEdit System Date': 13-Apr-84 11':44':53'Lisp System Date': 16-Apr-84 12':58':26'Machine': Dorado (Halasz)'Microcode version': 24,4'Memory size': 10000'Frequency': New Feature'Impact': Moderate''TEDIT.PUT.PCTB needs a third argument that is a flag that indicates that the PCTB should not be updated as the file is written.
