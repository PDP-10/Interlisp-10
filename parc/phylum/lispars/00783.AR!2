To type a comment into the bits of a bitmap, just put the cursor in the right place, and start typing.  Of course, you don''t get the capability of moving the text around as a unit (like in notepad --- you get to position a typed-in word), but it''s not clear how useful that would be anyways.  I don''t use Paint to create formatted documents, but just to scribble a quick note on a window.]'--------'[rrb 16/may/84  ---  Attn field changed to Greg.
