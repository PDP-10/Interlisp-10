The problem is that there is no Interlisp specification as to what to do on floating underflow.  ''Could you please submit an AR on that?  Namely, there is no specification for what should happen when you do e.g. (TIMES 5.E-38 5.E-38).  I see a SPECVAR being used in \MAKEFLOAT -- \UNDERFLOW -- but no specification or documentation on it.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  4-May-84 12':49':22Attn: JonlAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Language SupportSubsystem: ArithmeticMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files: </pre>
