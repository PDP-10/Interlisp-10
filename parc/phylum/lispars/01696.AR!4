It then asks''"Shall I just forget about compiling (X.;1) ?" to which I answer "y" also.  Then it goes into a break in CLOSEF complaining that X.;1 is not open (FILE NOT OPEN).  My workaround is just to RETFROM the CLOSEF, and everything works just fine.''--Tom''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SannellaEdit-Date: 20-Aug-84 18':11':19
