What it means is that you had some file open, but hadn''t done anything with it in a while, then somebody else on another machine tried to access the file in a conflicting way (reading a file you had open for write, or vice versa).  In this situation, the Leaf server breaks your access to the file and gives access to the other guy.  This is supposed to be some sort of insurance against a crashed host holding onto a file for too long, but in reality it''s a major headache for implementors.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date:  3-Jun-84 15':47':56</pre>
