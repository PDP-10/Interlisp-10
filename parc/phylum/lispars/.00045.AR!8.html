''For most of that time I was using the Carol full.sysout ( I can''t recall the date) made just before this one.  Then, typing &uarr;D or &uarr;C or &uarr;B or &uarr;E did nothing but print "&uarr;D" (or "&uarr;C" etc.).  Once in a while &uarr;C worked but I usually ended up booting out of Lisp.''I have been using this latest version (also a full.sysout) for a few days now.  The only control key which does not respond is &uarr;D.'''Stephanie'-----'Date': 13 Mar 84 15':24 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': AR 45': &uarr;D disabled'In-reply-to': lispar.Auto''s message of 13 Mar 84 11':34':07 PST (Tuesday)'To': LispSupport.pa''This is probably still the tedit bug that Tedit smashes the user''s interrupts with TEDIT.INTERRUPTS.'-----'Date': 14 Mar 84 21':42 PST'From': Kaplan.pa'Subject': TEdit': &uarr;D getting disabled'To': TEditSupport'cc': Kaplan.pa'TEdit-System-Date':  2-Mar-84 16':54':27'Lisp-System-Date': 13-Mar-84 10':21':31'Machine-Type': Dorado''I have a simple function that sets up a Tedit process on a window, and then moves the TTY.PROCESS back to what it was before.''Whenever I run this function, I end up with &uarr;D being disabled.  Perhaps I am doing something wrong.''The function is TEDITBUG on {Phylum}&lt;LFG&gt;PARSER&gt;TEDITBUG.  It will run in a vanilla FULL.  For convenience, here is its definition':'''[LAMBDA NIL  '	(TEDIT (OPENTEXTSTREAM) '			(CREATEW NIL "Lexicon Window")) '	(TTY.PROCESS (THIS.PROCESS] ''What''s going on?''--Ron'-----'Date': 15 Mar 84 15':04 PST'From': Sybalsky.pa'Subject': Re': TEdit': &uarr;D getting disabled'In-reply-to': Kaplan.pa''s message of 14 Mar 84 21':42 PST'To': Kaplan.pa, VanMelle'cc': TEditSupport.pa, LispSupport''Got it!  If the TTY was taken away from TEdit before it had set up the interrupts, the disabling was happening in the new TTY process.  After that, the original interrupts were lost--replaced by the TEdit interrupts.''I have a new, private version of TEdit which fixed it; it will be in the next release.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Jun-84 18':57':05Attn: Assigned To: Sybalsky.paIn/By: CarolDisposition: System: TextSubsystem: TEditMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
