Requires BACKGROUNDBUTTONEVENTFN mechanism, not available in <LISP>CURRENT> but present in <LISPCORE>NEXT.''Austin''----------''MOVE-WINDOWS is a tool to help you re-arrange your screen quickly. Once loaded, buttoning in the background will shift you into window-moving mode. Buttoning again in the background will get you out of that mode. The cursor shifts to (1 0)'(16 16'"OAHO"'"HBDA"'"H@@A"'"IOOI"'"AOOH"'"A@@H"'"EBDJ"'"IAHI"'"IAHI"'"EBDJ"'"A@@H"'"A@@H"'"IOOI"'"H@@A"'"HBDA"'"OAHO") when in window-moving mode.''In window-moving mode, buttoning in a window with the LEFT button will either reshape or move the window': if you button down near a corner, the corner is moved; near a side, that side is moved; in the center, the whole window is moved. (The window is divided  like a Tic-Tac-Toe board for determining these regions.) For best results, grab hold of the portion of the window you want to move (button down), drag it to the new position, and release it (button up). The cursor shifts to indicate the direction of dragging. ''Buttoning in a window with the MIDDLE button will, after mouse confirmation, close the window.''Buttoning in a window with the RIGHT button will call the usually window menu (DOWINDOWCOM).''Suggestions and problems to Austin Henderson (8*923-4322, 415-494-4322, <AHenderson@Xerox).''-----''Date':  2 Jul 84 13':24 PDT'From': Shrager.pa'Subject': Move windows'To': AHenderson, Halasz'cc': LispFriends^'Reply-to': Shrager.pa''Frank had implemented a package of "jestures" which was akin to your move windows except that it had the idea of reading the mouse''s trajectory in order to figure out what you had in mind.  For example, if you run back and forth across the edge of a window, it was closed, and if you "hooked" the corner, it went into move mode.''I wonder if these two packages could be cleverly combined.''(I''m cc''ing this to LispFriends in case anyone out there has a suggestion about how to combine them.)''-- Jeff''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: LibraryMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: Impact: Priority: Status: FixedProblem Type: Source Files:
