Apparently the DM2500 does this, and all the hosts I''ve used expect it.''...''I thought this was a Stanfor Twenex problem, since it only occurs there, but they claim to implement the standard correctly.  I really don''t know who''s at fault, but could someone who understands what''s going opn look at it?  We''ve been getting complaints from out students.''-------'Date': 31 May 84 15':47 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''A DM2500 does NOT clear the line when it receives a CR.''I''m not sure what your particular problem is, but perhaps it is related to a compromise in the Chat code with respect to a misfeature of the DM2500.  Namely, the DM2500 has autolinefeed': on receipt of a CR, it performs a CR, LF.  So that this doesn''t screw up when receiving a standard CR, LF, it goes into a state where if the next incoming character is a LF, it ignores it.''Chat emulates this by performing a CR and waiting for the next character; if it is anything other than a LF, it first does a LF.  The end result of this procedure is exactly the same as on a DM2500, but its intermediate state is different': if the host sends naked CR and waits, then Chat has not yet gone on to the next line.  This is a "feature" when you are talking to hosts that don''t know about DM2500''s but do perform scroll holding between the CR and the LF sent to terminate the last line of a screen full.  Maxc is an example.''If this is indeed your problem, we can discuss ways around it.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: vanMelleEdit-Date: 12-Jul-84 14':38':27
