From the new documentation':''The values displayed in an inspect window can be accessed by commands on the menu brought up by pressing the {lisp MIDDLE} button in the title of the window. The command "{lisp IT_datum}" sets the variable IT to the object being inspected in this window.  This is normally displayed in the title of the window.  The command "{lisp IT_selection}" sets the variable IT to the current property name or value selected in the inspect window.''I also changed the default SET routine to use GETPROMPTWINDOW.''richard''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 15':50':28
