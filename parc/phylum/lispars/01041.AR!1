E.g. try executing (VOLUMEDISPLAY ''ON)'after loading -- you''ll get ILLEGAL ARG': NOBIND.  But after you do'something like MKDIR or SETVOLUMETYPE things are setup correctly.  This'would probably go away when it is put in the loadup sequence, but I'thought I''d warn you about it.''Martin'-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date:  8-May-84 17':45':52Attn: Stansbury.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Operating SystemSubsystem: DLion DiskMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
