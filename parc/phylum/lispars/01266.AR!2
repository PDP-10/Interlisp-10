I button the browser graph to get a new function into the browser printout window. I then continue to type, expecting type-in to go to the DEDIT edit buffer instead typein appears to go nowhere.  In order to give the tty process back to the DEDIT I have to button the top level type script window (buttoning in the edit buffer isn''t enough).Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date:  1-Sep-84 12':08':20
