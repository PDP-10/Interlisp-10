Turned out that FILEPKGFLG = ADDSPELLFLG = BUILDMAPFLG = NIL.  These three variables happen to be ones that are RESETVAR''ed to NIL in LOAD when you load things SYSLOAD.I had done very little when this occurred--loaded ABC, several files SYSLOAD, ran SINGLEFILEINDEX on three files and started Lafite.''I can''t reproduce this.
