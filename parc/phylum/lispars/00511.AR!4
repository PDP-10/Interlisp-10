That is, whenever I LOGOUT, and then come back in to the same virtual image, the caret usually doesn''t flash at me.  As such, it''s difficult to know that we''ve completely logged back in and we''re ready for input.  It''s also difficult to tell exactly where you''re typing.  The way I normally get it flashing again is to type (CARET).  It''s not really a major problem, but it is a little annoying.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 16-Aug-84 13':00':13Attn: Assigned To: Burton.paIn/By: HarmonyDisposition: '[Date':  6 Apr 84 11':45 PST'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Lisp': ar #511 has been fixed'To': LispSupport.pa]System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: 1108Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: ClosedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
