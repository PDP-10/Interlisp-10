''Now': I think I''ve completed the surgery, but I haven''t sewn the patient back together yet': I''m working on Maxc and have tested the new DWIM and macro expansion interpreted, but I have not compiled the new versions. They are DWIMIFY and MACROS on &lt;LispCore&gt;Sources&gt;. ''Both files need BCOMPL rather than TCOMPL.''I will attempt compilation on Monday.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 21-Aug-84 18':07':52</pre>
