Even when the code output by the macro is clisp-free, the S-expression body of the macro should still be able to use clisp forms.''-----''Date':  9 May 84 13':31':31 PDT (Wednesday)'From': masinter.PA'Subject': Re': [JonL.pa': Want AR on loss of "if" during Rename phase]'In-reply-to': JonL''s message of 8 May 84 20':50 PDT'To': JonL'cc': Sannella, Masinter''I will warn you that this is a very tricky part of the system -- I get lost every time I touch it and it takes a couple of days to get out.
