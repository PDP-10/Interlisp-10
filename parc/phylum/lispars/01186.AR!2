When I tried to deliver it, I told it to deliver plain text then got an illegal arg {imageobj}.  The imageobj was an MB (menu button) from the ar that was in the body of the message.  John believes there is a missing call to COERCETOTEXT some where in lafite.''It occurs to me that this may be a place to call the IMAGEOBJ PREPRINTFN and that the PREPRINTFN for menu buttons should produce the text (The PREPRINTFN currently for MBs is NIL.)''richard''-----''Date': 16 May 84 11':11 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': Illegal arg {imageobj} under gv.addtoitem'In-reply-to': Burton.pa''s message of 16 May 84 10':48 PDT'To': Burton.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa, Sybalsky.pa, Sannella.pa''When sending plain text, Lafite does not call COERCETEXTOBJ, assuming that BIN will produce plain text.  In the case where the text has imageobj''s in it, of course, such an approach has no hope of producing text for the imageobj, and Lafite should probably at least warn you about that.''The error you report is where BIN of a textstream is getting not a byte, but an IMAGEOBJ.  From my point of view, that is clearly a Tedit bug.  I suspect the view is different from TeditSupport.  Perhaps we need to talk about what the right thing is.''	Bill''-----''Date': 22 Aug 84 15':26 PDT'From': masinter.pa'Subject': AR/Lafite incompatibility'To': Sannella, LafiteSupport''If I shift-select from an AR window into a Lafite window and attempt to deliver (and I selected one of the headers, e.g.':''Description': )''then it fails in a  couple of ways.
