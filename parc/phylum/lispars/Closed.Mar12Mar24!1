The situation was this:  I needed to augmentthe record package to include something of the form:(make <newitem> memberof <path> of <object>)which would translate to:(OR (MEMBER <newitem> (fetch <path> of <object>))    (replace <path> of <object> with      (CONS <newitem> (fetch <path> of <object>))))So I then wrote a "tran" function and placed this function on theCLISPWORD property of MAKE, make, MEMBEROF and memberof.  "OF" and"of" already had RECORDTRAN on the CLISPWORD property so I left it(the doc on CLISPWORD (p 16.22) did not say it could be a list.)Now, when a function containing my "make" form was prettyprinted boththe words "make" and "memberof" were boldface (the CLISPFONT) but theword "of" was in plain text.  To make a long story short, it turns outthat in order for prettyprint to print CLISPWORDs in the CLISPFONT eachword must have the same "tran" function on the CLISPWORD property.I don't know whether to call this a bug or a "feature."							JeffP.S. I solved my problem by making "make" and "memberof" bothRECORDTRAN CLISPWORDs (like "of") and ADVISING RECORDTRAN to usemy "tran" if it sees the "make" keyword.-------*start*00368 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 Mar 84 14:24 PSTFrom: Burton.paSubject: Re: Lisp: Loading problemsIn-reply-to: Denber.wbst's message of 8 Mar 84 15:18 ESTTo: Denber.wbstcc: Burton.pa, Hannaway.wbst, LispSupport.paI mis-spoke about there being a new lisp.run, there isn't.

It will compile the synopsis butstash it in a hashfile rather than on the property list.This "compilation" process is somewhat similar to the analysis that theextension to SINGLEFILEINDEX does -- I'm wondering if the lower-levelsupport ought not to go into the system (in FILEPKG).Incidentally, I forgot to mention that the one lacuna in LISPSOURCEFILEP isthis: a non-RANDACCESSP file *** which is already OPENP *** can't be hacked.A little thought about lacunae in NS filing will show why (GETFILEPTR fails, in addition to SETFILEPTR's problems).*start*00458 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 Mar 84 11:01 PSTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Re: Lisp: ERRORTYPELST -- another candidate for process globalsIn-reply-to: JonL.pa's message of 7 Mar 84 23:12 PSTTo: JonL.pacc: LispSupport.paWhy don't we make ERRORTYPELST a simple SPECVAR, not a global at all.

Is it really all that useful now for TEdit's first arg to be entered in the buffer when it is a STRINGP?  I.e., why type the data as a string argument?

Then another break window came up (for no good reason) which just said "PROG break1".  Shortly after that, the machine went into an infinite loop of bringing up new break windows (overlaying each other); it was trying to print out some message to a displaystream for which WFROMDS wanted to create a WINDOW (looping around again because of some error).The mouse and interrupts were completely dead  during this ballet of break windows.  Finally a stack overflow afforded me the opportunity to HARDRESET several times (the first time didn't do it!).At least the phony break windows were partiallyh overlapping the background, so they could be disposed by:  (while (WHICHW) do (CLOSEW (WHICHW)))*start*01954 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 11 Mar 84 01:50 PSTFrom: Halasz.paSubject: Re: Lisp: DLion Local File SystemIn-reply-to: Sheil.pa's message of 10 Mar 84 10:04 PSTTo: Sheil.pacc: Halasz.pa, LispSupport.pa I am very unsatisfied with your answer w.r.t. the DLion file system.  I want to stress that from my perspective (as a DLion user and as the technical support for the PSA and ARI-Leesburg projects) the Dlion file system is by a large margin the most serious problem with Interlisp-D.  I believe that this perspective is shared by a large number of other DLion users and, more importantly, by the customers in the real world.  (In fact, I recently received feedback to this effect from the people working on a DLion installed in the IMF in Washington).  Given the importance of this piece of code, it is very disconcerting that no-one is working on it, or worse yet, no one is responsible for it.  It seems to me that it should be the #1 priority at the moment.I do have two suggestions:1)  Put someone in charge of the Dlion file system, even if they are not actively developing it.  Several times I have bombed with file system problems and run around looking for someone to look at the state of the machine.  No one has ever been willing to take responsibility for this task.  I have tried to debug the code by myself.  While I haven't found any major solutions, I can point out a number of bugs in the DLIONFS code I have discovered this way.  It seems like a knowledgeable person doing this task might gain a lot of valuable insight just by looking at various problems when they occur.2)  Assign someone to take a day and write a 4-page memo on the structure of the DLion file system and to comment the code as best as possible.  I would be willing to track down problems to the best of my ability.  But I have a hard time making heads or tails of the code as it now stands.   Frank *start*01158 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 12 Mar 84 15:28 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: TEdit: caret looksTo: TEditSupportcc: vanMelle.paTEdit-System-Date:  2-Mar-84 16:54:27Lisp-System-Date: 25-Feb-84 17:23:38Machine-Type: DoradoThere seems to be some new behavior here that is very annoying.  If I select the cr at the end of a paragraph and type <cr><New text>, the new text is in a font that appears to have nothing to do with any font nearby.  All the text in the neighborhood is in TimesRoman10, and the new text is in TimesRoman12 Bold, which is not even a font that I have breathed a word of in this editing session (though it is the font of the first character of the file, if that matters).If I instead select the text before the final cr (caret is in same place, but selection is some TimesRoman10 text instead of the invisible cr), then I get the new text in TimesRoman10 as I expect.I did notice, though, and applaud, that the looks of my typein are no longer affected by something that I copy select.  That is, I can copy an italicized word and not have my typein thereafter be in italics.	Bill*start*00407 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 10 Mar 84 16:42 PSTFrom: Halvorsen.paSubject: TEdit: Several different units used in the menuTo: TEditSupportTEdit-System-Date:  1-Mar-84 13:54:34Lisp-System-Date:  1-Mar-84 14:24:22Machine-Type: DandelionWhat is the relationship between the unit used in the margin bar, and the unit used for specifying default tab size?*start*01266 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 10 Mar 84 10:04 PSTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Re: Lisp: DLion Local File SystemIn-reply-to: Halasz.pa's message of 9 Mar 84 15:27 PSTTo: Halasz.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Brown.pa, Moran.paFrank:I am indeed sorry to hear that the unreliability of the DLIONFS code has been causing you problems.

Despite Tayloe's changes to the directory paths in this loadup procedure today, it is still not looking in the right place.   When I tried to remedy this by putting the dlispdomino where it did look,  (an on-the-fly fix more likely to win than changing the dir path half way through loadup) I received the warning that the version number did not agree with the interface page.  The loadup later died in a raid-from-ucode.  The user stack had only a clearstk, and the system stack had only a dofault (3frames deep, only).  It wouldn't let me see the lisp screen to see how far the loadup had gotten.  It had built the init.dlinit and the init.sysout.  I was going to retry with another dlispdomino.db but (guess what) none on lispcore>next.  The newest thing on lispcore was created Jan 1.   It is not obvious to me why the wrong dlispdomino.db should cause the loadup to die after getting so far, but raid gave me no context to try and deduce the problem.  First, is the warning about version disagreement a result of the wrong dlispdomino.db?

Actually, Tim mentions a more difficult problem - saving back releases of lisp (and lispusers packages). Though this was a bigger concern in the Chorus-to-Fugue transition, it concerns me that there appears to be no careful distinction of versions with the lispusers and lisp>library files and not all of the releases get archived. Is this true? (Tim's mention of no Chorus files on Phylum).In our case - since I only pull over lispusers files as we need them due to space constraints - if we need a file that goes with the previous release (since Trillium is always a bit behind the new lisp release), I can't be assured that I'll find the compatible file (the file on {phylum}<lispusers> may be updated for the new release, and the old one is gone). For example, Doug decided to try running Lafite about a month ago, but due to the Carol release I don't think he was able to find all of the files that he needed. We're now only able to run Lafite on Carol which is not compatible with Halloween. This doesn't seem like an easy thing to control, but maybe the only solution is to keep a full copy of {phylum}<lispusers> on Aztec.Any thoughts?-Kathy     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*00665 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 13 Mar 84 11:17:55 PST (Tuesday)Subject: Re: Wait till he discovers the parenthesis keyIn-reply-to: Your message of 12 Mar 84 14:45:08 PST (Monday)To: Newmancc: LispUsers^.pa, HamiltonFrom: Bruce Hamilton <Hamilton.ES>Reply-To: Hamilton.ESActually, the letter implies a serious question, related to trying to communicate with other forms of intelligent life: is there an approach, to giving inputs and observing output to an unknown program, which is in some sense optimal; i.e. leads to a complete characterization of input - output pairs in the shortest possible time?--Bruce*start*00483 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 13 Mar 84 13:05 PSTFrom: Sybalsky.paSubject: Re: Lisp: TEdit and TEditMenuIn-reply-to: Feuerman.pasa's message of 13 Mar 84 11:13 PSTTo: Feuerman.pasacc: LispSupport.pa, TEditSupport.paTry loading it from <Lispcore>Library>, which is where the latest public TEdit is stored.

Alternatively, remembering all the "hjappenings" since a message was placed in this folder, available by buttoning the mark letter with middle button would solve the same problem.

The problem was that there was no link from the string to that particular stream:  the next read from the string, inside the readmacro function, would create an entirely new stream and read it from the beginning.The idea that we discussed, of having READ always pass the stream instead of the fullname, seemed problematical, since there were in fact a number of machine-independent readmacro functions in the system that specifically test the filename (usually to see if it was (EQ -- T).So I postponed making the giant leap, and instead took the smaller step of not having streams produced by OPENSTRINGSTREAM have the string as their name.  Not having an explicit name, their FULLNAME is the stream datum itself.String streams that are produced by implicitly by simply reading from the string will have the string name, so that they will continue to show up on openfiles, and thus also be retrievable again by subsequent IO operations.Jim:  You might try your string reading macros in the next <lispcore> loadup.--Ron*start*00430 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 15 Mar 84 01:05 PSTFrom: desRivieres.paSubject: Re: AR 41:  READ, OPENSTRINGSTREAM, & RDTBLIn-reply-to: Kaplan.pa's message of 14 Mar 84 23:46 PSTTo: Kaplan.pacc: LISPSUPPORT.PA, DesRivieres.pa, Lispcore^.paGood stuff!

For devices which are external to the machine and which might change state over a LOGOUT or SYSOUT, it is important that FULLNAME actually be an identifier of the stream, so that the across-logout across-sysout feature can attempt to re-find the file.For some devices, e.g., the STRING device, there is no good handle of that form, and (FULLNAME STREAM) should return STREAM.

This was accomplished bydis-assembling the RSX ethernet driver (yes, they only left us the .TSK files),and then making improvements to the driver.   The major improvement wasgreatly increasing the speed of the transfer of the ethernet packet fromthe task buffer to the driver buffer (A driver buffer is necessary as theXerox hardware can only DMA to the low 64 Kbytes).   Now we are gettingtransfers in both directions at 10.5 Kbits/sec. and the RSX system is nearlyalways busy during the transfer.   Anyone who might profit from this isinvited to mail me, Hal Brand - BRAND@LLL-MFE.ARPA, and I will be glad toprovide any and all details.   My thanks to all who responded about the problem.   The notion thatmultiple packets we sent to the RSX machine gave me the confidence to spendthe time to dis-assemble the driver in an effort to increase its through-putso as not to allow the 2nd packet to be missed.   I am no pretty sure thatthe problem was that the RSX handler was so slow that the 2nd packet waslost by RSX and then the dolphin had to wait 3 to 5 seconds to time-out theresponse to the 2nd packet before re-transmitting it.   Again, my thanks to all.							Hal Brand							BRAND@LLL-MFE.ARPA*start*00481 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 15 MAR 84 10:32 PSTFrom: MASINTER.PASubject: Want faster DIR and FILEBROWSERTo:   LispSupportThe performance of DIR and FILEBROWSER is unacceptable for remote files.

Au contraire, there are plenty of Lisp problems lurking there.  Perhaps we have been lulled by a lack of fresh reports on the problem.Syntelligence have had so many problems NSFiling that they have basically quit using it, and are relying on floppy and flaky {dsk} to store their stuff.  They have however been able to sysout to their fileserver successfully with their pre-Carol lisp (thanks largely to Bill's work on this problem).  Makefile etc. are apparently still a disaster.NSFiling was a considerable nuisance in the lispcourse in Watford.   File interactions usually (though by no means always) completed successfully.  But they frequently seemed to spawn 3-5 filing processes each, n-1 of which would get confused and periodically promptprint "Filing#i not responding" ad infinitum.  Why it takes more than one process to accomplish a makefile I don't know.  It seems as if all the spurious processes were waiting for the fileserver to tell them something, but were not reminding the fileserver they were waiting to be served.  And sometimes file interactions broke, usually when trying to close a file. People at the course who had NS fileservers at home said that they had the same problems on their own installations. It seems that after the thaw, we must allocate some resources to fixing the Lisp end of NSFiling.  For starters, we must appoint some Phylex users: to the best of my knowledge, NO ONE is using it now.  I for one volunteer.  But I do not wish to be alone.  And once NSFiling seems solid, I don't see any reason why we can't tackle transparently caching files on the local disk -- it can't take more than a couple days to design and implement.-- Tayloe.       ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*00720 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 15 Mar 84 10:44 PSTFrom: Sannella.paSubject: [Raim.pasa: Re: Lisp: NS Filing: Raised Priority]To: LispSupport     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Date: 21 Feb. 1984 1:18 pm PST (Tuesday)From: Raim.pasaSubject: Re: Lisp: NS Filing: Raised PriorityIn-reply-to: Stansbury.pa's message of 16 Feb 84 19:25 PSTTo: Stansbury.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Cooper.pa, Sheil.paTayloe,I am considering Jerry Fung as the NS-networking resource for this problem.

Tioga uses the Laurel convention of placeholders that allows you to fill in forms easily.  If you hit the placeholder key (the middle unmarked key on the right) the editor moves the selection to the next placeholder in the document.  This can be used to fill out forms (as this Lisp report) or to fill in parameters on a function call.  In Cedar, if you type a procedure name and then ^E, the procedure name will be followed by a form for all of the parameters (sort of like what ?= does).  Then you can fill in the parameters one by one, moving from one parameter to the next just by hitting the placeholder key.Thanks,John.P.S.

Here's the documenation:"(COPYCHARS  SRCFIL DSTFIL START END)is like COPYBYTES except that it performs the proper conversion if the EOL conventions of SRCFIL and DSTFIL are not the same.  START and END are interpreted as byte specifications in SRCFIL.  The number of bytes actually output to DSTFIL might be more or less than the number of bytes specified by START and END, depending on what the EOL conventions are.

It's working well enough to survive all my testing so I'm looking for more traffic to smoke out the next layer of bugs.If you are willing to type a few extra characters on some of your messages that aren't too important read on.If you would normally send a msg to X@Y, sending it to "X@Y".NotArpa will get it to my machine instead. I'll strip off the .NotArpa and the ""s, and forward it to the right place. On the way out to the Arpanet, I'll fixup the return addresses so that answering mail will come back via PARC-GW.ARPA rather than PARC-MAXC.ARPA.When you send a message to a recipient whose name contains an @, your mail processing software adds a .ARPA (or .AG, or .ArpaGateway) if it doesn't already end in one. The .NotArpa gets your message to my machine, and the ""s hide the @ so it doesn't get sent to Maxc.I don't yet do the right thing with addresses of the form @A,@B:X@Y so please avoid them for now. Also, I don't do \ processing when stripping "s, so don't try nesting "s.The server is currently running on my Dorado. It will obviously be down while it's waiting for me to look at a fatal bug or I'm working on something else.

[Ref exchange of messages between Kim Korner and LorrraineKiewert].  This was unintentional. I did not go tothe 100 support group first because at first I did not know that it existed.I'll use them first next time, appropriately I hope.Unfortunately, I do not imagine they will answer the most important questionsI have, which are not questions about specific bugs, but about the general range of functionality and software support planned in certain large and expensive areas. These questions may be just inherently embarrassing, in thespecific sense that answering them forces Xerox into policy committments.It is not my intent to do that, buut customers do have some right to knowthese things. Therefore I will address them to you thusprivately; you may burn this message, and reply however you see fit.I will be glad to ask them inn another forum if you prefer.The relation between Interlisp and the file server is unsatisfactory at several points. This does not worry me particularly on the assuumption that it willbe fixed eventually, but I have  not yet found anyone who can say "Yes, we'reworking on that" or how it will look whenn fixed.Doing a directory of something like <LISP> takes much too long.Doing a directory of <LISP>FOO.* takes just as long.MMAKEFILE, TEDIT, and many other operations fail, crash, and go wrongdue to the lack of a random access protocol. Will our file server eventually support random access?Will there ever be a release of Fugue/Carol etc which is fully interrupt driven?Will there be an acceptable text-editing and document handlingfacility any time soon? TEDIT is not one in its present state.I would not object to it at all if I were told that it is just the currentversion of a program being developed further, and that one could expect majorimprovements this year. Those questions are probably the most important ones I have.I could report little bugs by the basketful. I don't consider it veryconstructive, because most of them look to me like things you all undoubtedlyknow about already and probably have alredy fixed in your latest working systemor else things which are obviously derived from major issues like random access.I try to report those which system people might be glad to hear about.They don't need to be told 100 different things which go wrong when random access files don't work. At least that was what I thought when I wasdoing system work.I am re-reading your messages.About the chain of command:Uwe Hein and I have worked together for 4 years or so.He is formally my thesis advisor, when I work on that.He has now reduced his committment to the University to part timein order to run Epitec.  which among other things is the "Xerox supportgroup" here. Tomas Lund also sits here with us, and works for Epitec.It was when he and Christer Haegstrom were blocked after several daysof work on the RS232 problem, and nobody knew anything more to try,that I decided to try breaking into Parc with netamil to find out where to go.I have heard about Gittins. He wrote a users guide, which isa service. Otherwise London Xerox seems from here to be a rather unnecessarylevel of indirection, but probably others like Christer see benefits in havingthem which are not obvious to me.Found your other message about my talking to the guys at Stanford.I did not really ask them to solve our problem, I asked them sort ofgenerally who had installations like ours. I gather they don't, and you don't.  I still do not know of any place which is all NS, no PUP;all 1108, no 1100 or Altos or whatever; and has lots of DEC machines totalk to.I am aware that we have not investigated the possibility of using PUP totalk to the DEC-20. That is a project which we are pursuing, but the information comes slowly, andthen it takes me time to get around to reading it.In any case, I will try not to upset your applecarts by asking too manyawkward questions in the users' group discussion,. without trying Xerox first.Jim-------*start*01117 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@From: masinter.paDate: 16-Mar-84  1:51:25 PSTSubject: RSX file server, for the filesTo: lispsupport----------Received: from LLL-MFE.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA; 15 MAR 84 15:35:09 PSTDate: Thu, 15 Mar 84 15:04 PSTFrom: "Brand Hal"@LLL-MFE.ARPASubject: RSX file serverTo: masinter.pa   The driver, etc. came with Phil Young of Xerox (Pasadena I believe).The Dolphin was leased (we had all kinds of problems with Lab lawyers oncontracts) with the provision that Xerox provide the software for usingour RSX machine as a file server.

The user can say (READ NIL), with NIL --> T.  The macro functions are also testing (EQ FILE T), and would behave incorrectly.  Passing thru the name unchanged would also be a step backwards down the path we want to go on--towards passing streams only.If we wanted to go around and edit all the affected macro functions, one tack to take is to make them internally call FULLNAME on the file argument, and test that against T if that's what they want to do.  That would make it work whether we passed in the user's partial name, or the stream. This is for the future, when we have more energy for random perturbations.  (And also, we would have to make sure that FULLNAME  of a fullname ran acceptably fast on the 10).--Ron*start*01663 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 17 MAR 84 13:40 PSTFrom: JONL.PASubject: Re: AR 41:  READ, OPENSTRINGSTREAM, & RDTBLTo:   Kaplan, JONLcc:   LISPSUPPORT, DesRivieres, Lispcore^In response to the message sent  16 Mar 84 14:12 PST from Kaplan.paThe documented macrocharacter function interface doesn't specify that the "file" argument has been in any way perturbed, so any changes to such a"perturbation" should affect only the system-supplied macrochar fns whichdepended upon this undocumented kludge.True, the "right" way to go is to coerce to STREAMs, but my R.I.P commentsstill apply for any code that wants to be compatible with the PDP10.How about this as an "interim" measure:  1) convert any litatom argument to READ into FULLNAME of that litatom  2) leave STREAM arguments aloneCertainly, no PDP10 code would be affected by point (2), and point (1)would catch all current cases of PDP10 READs.In fact, I can't see any other solution in general for STREAMS (than toleave them alone) since it is perfectly acceptable to create a streamwhich supports most I/O operations except FULLNAME.  Worse yet, how evercan one expect FULLNAME to  be information-preserving when there are multiplestreams open on the same file.There aren't that many system-supplied macrocharacter fns (simply scanningthe three initial readtables will find them all).  They could simply have(SETQ FULL (COND ((STREAMP FILE) (FULLNAME FILE)) (T FILE)))which, by point (1) above, would always guarantee that FULL was theFULLNAME of the file, but would never call FULLNAME unnecessarily (especiallyon the PDP10).*start*01114 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 17 MAR 84 22:54 PSTFrom: MASINTER.PASubject: Re: AR 41:  READ, OPENSTRINGSTREAM, & RDTBLTo:   JONL, Kaplancc:   LISPSUPPORT, DesRivieres, Lispcore^ In response to the message sent 17 MAR 1984 1340-PST by JONL.PAI think Ron introduced the minimal change which had the positive characteristics of:a) it actually fixed the problem which started the whole thingb) it didn't break anything elsec) it didn't commit us to immediately undertaking major rewrites of the system that we don't have the resources to pursue.There are a number of major items which are demanding attention from Ron , you, me, etc. which this discussion merely distracts us from.

This is the small matter of programming,  i.e. to see to it that the right functions get called when escape sequences come in from the host.  I thought that there might simply be an a-list of escape sequences and screen operations, in which case implementing a new terminal type would be very simple, but that is not the case.Furthermore,  Jonl expressed the worry that certain screen operations on a Dlion, like clearing the screen, inserting a line etc.  will take so long that the host will start sending "text" before the DLion has completed the screen operation since it believes it is talking to an intelligent which is faster at doing this. There is not buffering in DSPVTS, so  characters  sent while the DLION is busy would fall on the floor.  Jonl suspected that you might not be able to run faster than 300 baud.

Thus, @ encodes 0000, A encodes 0001, B encodes 0010, etc. up to O.  We did it with this half-dense encoding so as to avoid characters with any special properties on lisp symbolic files.An example:(8 2 "@B" "CF")These s-expression representations are simply printed on the file by PRINTBITMAP and the bitmaps command, and read and converted back to a real bitmaps by READBITMAP.Hope this helps.Ron*start*00574 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 16 Mar 84 17:39:44 PST (Friday)From: Masinter.PASubject: Re: Shulman In-reply-to: Your message of 15 Mar 84 14:17:12 ESTTo: LispSupportcc: KaplanThings to do:Put  LLKEY (mouse/keyboard sources) and LLARRAYELT (array reference & hash) on some Maxc directory, set protection to Read access for world, and send pointer to Shulman@RutgersSubmit AR on Release process, attn Raim: all files in LISP.SYSOUT and not in SMALL.SYSOUT should be on <Lisp>Library> released.

Also the arguments X and Y were reversed, so I fixed them to accord with the manual.There is an undocumented function ATAN on AARITH which looks like someone's botched attempt to copy the PDP-10 MacLisp version.  I've supplied a correct translation (from the machine language, glaaag!), but I suspect that this one just ought to be deleted (Masterscope  finds no system callers of ATAN).  Aside from everything else, it appears to duplicate the functionality of ARCTAN2.I've also fixed a glitch in several of the generic arithmetic functions (ABS, PLUS, MINUS, and TIMES) whereby they forced the "hard case" of a microcoded floating point operation.  By changing, e.g. (FDIFFERENCE 0 X) into (FDIFFERENCE 0.0 X), forms like (ABS 3.4) and (TIMES <fp-number1> <fp-number2>) were speed up by a factor of from 2 to 5.

This was done originally because user functions might not be prepared to handle stream arguments, and might be doing outragious things to them like packing chars on, STRPOS etc.In the case of the string stream, this is obviously a mistake, since the stream created by OPENSTRINGSTREAM is not cached in the open file table.  A new stream is then created and cached with the fullname (= the string) is passed in to READ.I'm willing to change the specs so that the macro function gets the stream, and hope that it doesn't cause lots of incompatibilities.

I am currently working within the Interlisp-D support group, trying to establish an "AR" database of bug reports, proposed features, etc.  Larry Masinter forwarded your message (of Thu, 15 Mar 84) to me, saying "Extract as many ARs as you can, and send summary back to Goodwin with as many replies as you can to his questions."  Looking through your message, I found that your questions were not specific enough for me to extract any bug reports.  Let me try answering them as well as I can....----"The relation between Interlisp and the file server is unsatisfactory at several points.  <<<what problems have you found, specifically>>>  This does not worry me particularly on the assuumption that it will be fixed eventually, but I have  not yet found anyone who can say "Yes, we're working on that" or how it will look whenn fixed.Doing a directory of something like <LISP> takes much too long.Doing a directory of <LISP>FOO.* takes just as long."Improving the performance of Interlisp in its use of NS file servers is a high-priority item within the Interlisp support group.-----"MAKEFILE, TEDIT, and many other operations fail, crash, and go wrong due to the lack of a random access protocol. Will our file server eventually support random access?"Eventually, the file server should be able to support random access.  The Interlisp-D support group does not have much control over that that (although we have tried to emphasize the importance of random access).  A temporary fix that we are working on is to automatically copy files onto the local machine when dealing with a non-random access file server.-----"Will there ever be a release of Fugue/Carol etc which is fully interrupt driven?"What do you mean?  What do you want to do that you can't do now?-----"Will there be an acceptable text-editing and document handling facility any time soon? TEDIT is not one in its present state.  I would not object to it at all if I were told that it is just the current version of a program being developed further, and that one could expect major improvements this year."Do you mean that Tedit is not acceptable because you cannot use it with your non-random access file servers, or are you saying that even if this problem was solved, that Tedit would not provide acceptable functionality?  What would be "an acceptable text-editing and document handling facility" to you?  Tedit will containue to be developed, and its formatting facilities improved.

Because Lisp uses ASCII and NS printers use the NS character set, we have to do some character conversions.	These conversions are needed at 3 places in the INTERPRESS code; the Fugue.6 release as of now has it in one of the three.	{Phylum}<Lispcore>Sources>INTERPRESS[.dcom] has all of the conversions in place.  I was able to run listings, and the characters appeared everywhere they should.  This code could be imported into the release, if the demand is great enough; it does not affect other parts of the system.Ron--	I changed everything but APPENDIDENTIFIER.IP to do the conversion to NS charsets.  Unfortunately, things like font names, e.g., "XEROX XC82-0-0 TERMINAL" want the hyphens to be ASCII hyphens!  Since APPENDIDENTIFIER is the guy who emits those, I changed it to do no conversions.  IP.PRIN3 et al noe CONVERT TO NS.  There is also a function, NCHARS.IP, which returns the # of chars in the NS version of the string.     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*00890 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 15 Mar 84 13:14 PSTFrom: Sannella.paSubject: [Raim.pasa: Re: More on "Terminal"-font problems]To: LispSupport     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Date: Wed, 14 Mar 84 12:38 PSTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: Re: More on "Terminal"-font problemsIn-reply-to: "Sybalsky.pa's message of 14 Mar 84 11:18 PST"To: Sybalsky.pacc: MASINTER.pa, Raim, Phillips, Sannella.pa, Kaplan.paJohn,Thank you for your thorough analysis of the problem.

We should automate the running of standard benchmarks so that the Release Master can easily compare the relative performance on the new and old systems.  In fact, we should make sure that the results of the various benchmarks are captured in machine-readable form, so that the Release Master can be notified of any changes above some threshhold (e.g. 20% faster or slower, or 20% more or less conses, etc.)Besides preventing us from making gross mistakes, this information should find its way into the release message:1.  If we find more than, say, a 20% improvement on something, we should broadcast that to our users, to maintain their rising expectations.2.  If we find a performance decrement of 20% and we can verify that it is not an error, than users can be told to expect this, and also told what clever trade-offs we made--what else got faster or better.  Even if there is some bad news, it is better that we broadcast it in a controlled fashion indicating that we are on top of the situation rather than have users angrily discover it for themselves.--Ron     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*01505 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 15 Mar 84 12:57 PSTFrom: Sannella.paSubject: [vanMelle.pa: Re: Tedit continuous scrolling - my vote]To: LispSupport     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Date: 13 Mar 84 11:10 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Tedit continuous scrolling - my voteIn-reply-to: Burton.pa's message of 6 Jan 84 13:46 PSTTo: Sybalsky.pa, Burton.pacc: LispCore^.paI vote with Richard--Tedit should continuously scroll a line at a time, like everyone else.  Having the scroll quantum determined by the vertical position in the scroll bar was an interesting experiment, but I just don't see it being a good feature, even substantially damped (as Richard proposes as a compromise).  First, of course, it's incompatible with all the other windows in the system--I would have to be aware of what kind of window in order to know whether it cared where I was in the scroll bar.  But more significantly, I find that it is hard to get slow scrolling--I absolutely must position myself very close to the top of the scroll bar, which is almost never where I am inclined to go.  When I am scrolling thru a document, I typically position the cursor in the bottom half of the scroll bar in order to scroll thru in big chunks, up to a windowfull at a time.  When I get to a part that I want to scroll slowly, I DON'T want to have to move to the top of the scroll bar; I just want to hold the button down.	Bill     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*00485 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 15 Mar 84 13:27 PSTFrom: Sannella.paSubject: [masinter.pa: AR 51]To: LispSupport     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Date: 14 Mar 84 18:37 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: AR 51To: SANNELLAcc: I think that errors in documentation should be categorized under Documentation/Release Notes rather than Text/TTYIN.

Will try to rethink.But for the record:  The fix I installed does not make it impossible to re-open an explicit string stream, if a closed instance of such a thing is given to OPENSTRINGSTREAM.  What is required is a generic facility for re-opening basebyte streams--a facility that should be installed anyway (on the last cycle, I added that kind of thing to various other file devices).  The string stream, even without having a pointer to the string iteself, has enough information to reopen from the stream.

If you are running a stand-alone system, the only error indication you get when the system goes into RAID or some other MP error is a single four digit number in the MP and NOTHING ELSE.  There is no way to make sense of this information.  All there is a short information file giving a few cryptic words about the meaning of each MP number.  There is no way to see the msg that would be printed by Raid on a Dolphin/Dorado, there is no way to examine the stack or variable settings.  Basically, there is no way to debug the machine.  YET, Interlisp is designed to pop into a MP error or RAID at the slightest provacation.  The result of this mess is a very, very unpleasant experience for stand-alone DLion users.  At least in the good old days of ABENDS and IEH0023, there was an error manual that expended some effort to explain the meaning of the error numbers.  On stand-alone 1008s, there is nothing at all.For networked systems the problem is much less severe, since TELERAID does work very well under this conditions.  The problem is that it is a royal pain to use.  One needs two machines to do any debugging using TeleRAID.  This means either dedictating two machines to a single debugging project or running around trying to find a spare every time you pop into TeleRAID.  If the debugging task involves popping into TeleRAID at some regular intervals this can be a real headache.  RAID on the Dolphin/Dorados is infinitely easier to use efficiently since a single machine suffices.I understand the problems of writing a separate adress space debugger on the DLion.  But I just wanted to provide some user feedback that might help set development priorities.Frank*start*00971 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 18 Mar 84 21:12 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: auto-display-after-delete suggestionIn-reply-to: kaplan.pa's message of 18-Mar-84 20:27:31 PSTTo: kaplan.pacc: lafitesupport.paDo you have LAFITEDISPLAYAFTERDELETEFLG set to ALWAYS?

Thus, once I had closed the stream, I had no way of reopening it.On my little TRS-80 model 100, they support RS232 by making you open a stream on the device, and using the file name to give the paramters.  That might be a good model for how to run RS232 in Interlisp-D. Translating it into Interlisp-ese, this would say:stream_(OPENSTREAM '{RS232}1200.XON 'BOTH) would (a) initialize the hardware (instead of RS232INIT), and create the open stream. (On the Radio Shack one the "name" was a more terse code which encoded baud rate, whether Xon/Xoff was enabled, number of stop-bits, parity, etc.  For all I know, it is industry or at least MicroSoft standard.)Attempting to OPENSTREAM an RS232 stream when one is already open could generate a FILE WONT OPEN error. [In general, the design principle is that if there are "generic" functions which map reasonably into the device-specific ones, they should be used rather than special purpose ones. For example, GETFILEINFO and SETFILEINFO can be used for setting up various parameters of streams where possible if they don't fit into other file operations; loading extra information into the file name is reasonable and done in almost all operating systems.]-----Date: 19 Mar 84 19:36 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: non-closable streamsIn-reply-to: KAPLAN.pa's message of 19-Mar-84  0:06:02 PSTTo: KAPLAN.pacc: MASINTER.pa, LispCore^.paThe latter point may be an AR, but what is the AR?

Thus (CLOSEF window) is a no-op.  This maintains integrity, and means, for example, that you could SEE a file to a window without having the window's stream getting smashed at the end.It is tempting to map CLOSEF into CLOSEW, taking a very general notion of closing an object.

Thus if one were to     set GENNUM to 1234567 and then call GENSYM, he would get A1234568     instead of A4568.  This part was in the message I sent to Gadol etc     in early January documenting the new gensym capabilities [in fact, there     are other new capabilities -- all extensions that arent affected by     the documented user interface -- byut Tayloe and I were still desiging     these when release time came, so it didn't make sense to document their     half-baked state]So the question to ask is if they are setting GENNUM.

Furthermore it simply *** cannot *** bemaintained when we permit multiple streams on file devices -- a capabilitywhich the MacLisp world has had "for decades".Also, I checked the half-dozen places in system code that usethe FULLNAME access, and 90% of them are merely informational -- e.g.,when \EOSERROR is called, it's trying to tell you something more thanthe octal address of the STREAM which hit end-of-file.  The other 10%are used in cases where the stream has assuredly been obtained from afile device, and thus it will have a litatom fullname; these are the placesthat will have to be inspected when multiple openings are permitted.All that being said against the alleged "invariant", I find that I mustconcur with Ron -- that, if you, Larry Masinter, seem to think thatthere is such an invariant, then just maybe maybe some other user outthere in the hinterland watched the results of FULLNAME on file devicesand began to write code  thinking the same thing.In order not to risk finding out the hard way if there really are suchusers with "breakable" code, I propose to add a new function to FILEIO calledTRUENAME which will return the full file name (if the stream is connectedto some real file on a device), and othewise will return the TRUENAME propertyfrom the "property list" of the stream, the OTHERPROPS field.TRUENAME is appropriate, since this "invariant" is expressly disavowedin the MacLisp world (which has such a named function) -- one simply hasto "hang onto" the stream because he can't generally find it again by simplyknowing the file's name.  Also, it's conceivable that someday the fullnamefield will differ from the "true" name of the file -- this happens on theITS file system because of "indirect" files, which are supported in any ofthe other popular operating systems.-----From: kaplan.paDate: 19-Mar-84 22:37:25 PSTSubject: Re: FULLNAME invariantIn-reply-to: JONL's message of 19 MAR 84 19:22 PSTTo: JONLcc: MASINTER, lispcore^I think there are two very separate uses to which FULLNAME is being put.One is the use of the FULLNAME of a file/stream as a handle on that file/stream.  In this use, the invariant that Larry pointed out must be preserved.  It was not being preserved by explicitly opened string streams, and I fixed that by making the FULLNAME of such streams be the stream itself.This make the read macro case work properly (not needing the change suggested later by JonL), but more than that, it made things like (READ (FULLNAME x)) produce the desired behavior of reading from the stream x, and not some new stream whose bytes were the same as the bytes underlying x.The second use of FULLNAME currently is to provide some user comprehensible description of the stream.  This is what is used in error messages, ought to be used in the pname of the stream, and is not subject to any invariant requirements.  The description is essentially pure text.  The most useful description for a string stream is in fact the string that the stream was originally built on.  This was the reason that I originally made the string be the fullname, and in my innocence and ignorance, triggered the bugs that prompted this endless discussion.My fix to make sure that the invariant property required by use (1) was obeyed had the undesirable side-effect of eliminating the string as serving the use (2) purpose, as JonL has observed.JonL also correctly observes that in the long run the use (1) invariant cannot be maintained in the current fashion for any stream.  This is because we will eventually allow for multiple streams open on the same file, so that if the fullname is simply the full name of the file as it is known on its device, then there could be several streams with the same name.  [Indeed, the string streams were installed as the first tentative move in this direction, so it is not surprising that they provoked this conceptual confusion].We will eventually have to decide how to deal with this, either by eliminating the notion of a type-able fullname as a handle on a stream, by including an integer in the fullname that indicates which stream instance is being specified, or in some other way.  But this is for the future--I didn't want to solve this problem when I made my bug fix, nor do I want to solve it now.However, it does seem important to distinguish the descriptive use of the fullname from the identifier use, because the descriptive use is important and will always be with us.  If we start making the distinction now, we will have one less problem to deal with when we finally bite the bullet.I think we should provide some access fns in the stream record to store the description when the description is not the same as the fullname, as a property in the OTHERPROPS field of the stream.  This would be used in system code when reporting errors involving the stream, peraps by the defprint, etc.  We should also provide a user handle on this field, perhaps by attributes in GETFILEINFO/SETFILEINFO, or perhaps now is the time to introduce the STREAMPROP function (cause we are really getting at properties of the stream, not the file behind it).  In either case, I prefer an attribute name like DESCRIPTION instead of JonL's proposal of TRUENAME--the whole point is that this description does not "name" anything.I agree with JonL that this should be done, but it is not high on my list of things to do.

That document unfortunately is out of date. One of the ways it is out of date is that it doesn't mention "streams".  It is pretty clear that FULLNAME is a unique handle on the open stream. One of the "file assumptions" we are breaking is that we are allowing FULLNAME to be a non-Literal Atom.One way to couch these design discussions would be to come up with a revision to the appropriate section of the VM; that is a reasonably formal specification which spells out the way in which the pieces interact with each other. (I'm retrieving the VM document from archive.)*start*02044 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 21 Mar 84 09:46 PSTFrom: Sannella.paSubject: [masinter.pa: Re: FULLNAME invariant]To: LispSupport.pa     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Date: 20 Mar 84 11:07 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Re: FULLNAME invariantIn-reply-to: kaplan.pa's message of 19-Mar-84 22:37:25 PSTTo: kaplan.pa, JonLcc: lispcore^.paThanks for your analysis. This "invariant" indeed cannot be maintained once we allow multiple streams on the same file; we should spec out the design for the multiple-stream proposal so that this and other ramifications are clear. We should fix the system read macros not to test (EQ file T), but what SHOULD they be testing???In the interim, it seems that many of the desirata would be alleviated if the printout of the stream datatype were fixed, e.g., if you had a string-stream on "This is a very long stream"it could print out as[stream]"This..."and a stream on {phylum}<LispCore>Fugue>Full.sysout;1 could printout[stream]{Phylum}<LispCore>Fugue>Full.sysout;1.Since the string can be very long, cutting off the printout after a fixed number of characters might be reasonable.I started this on [phylum]<LispUsers>STREAMPNAME. Basically, it just DEFPRINTs STREAM to print out something different. This needs to be expanded to handle the 'final version' of string-streams.I would imagine that, once the 'informational aspect' of the FULLNAME is gone, it would be more reasonable to change the end-of-file error to have the 'offender' be the STREAM rather than the FULLNAME.This is (a) less likely to break extant code, since the PNAME of datatypes is advertised as implementation and machine-dependent (b) ALSO necessary on the way to multiple-streams-on-the-same-file (since the end-of-file is on the STREAM and not the file), (c) gives more useful information in a lot of different contexts (e.g., in a stack inspector window, would be nice to see the STREAM argument with more info).     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*00352 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 21 Mar 84 10:35 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lisp: SINGLEFILEINDEX's processTo: LispSupport.pacc: vanMelle.paLisp-System-Date: 15-Mar-84 00:13:18Machine-Type: DoradoSINGLEFILEINDEX should spawn its process with BEFOREEXIT = DON'T so that LOGOUT doesn't interrupt it.*start*00546 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 21 Mar 84 10:47 PSTFrom: Burton.paSubject: Lisp: Filemap rewrite code isn't checking error typeTo: LispSupport.paLisp-System-Date: 15-Mar-84 00:13:18I ^Eed when a function was being fetched from a file to be editted (after the "loading from mumble;81" msg) and the system rewrote the file map for mumble, then fetched the function.

Attempts to send the message resulted in "Illegal RName" and "no server responded" messages. This was confusing. I figured out what happened by monitoring the ethernet. I would suggest either picking off the registry from the disk name or having some menu-driven way to set and reset the registry.

I have to muck around to get the font changed from the variable pitch font that I prefer for most messages, and even after doing that, the tabs are not right.I'd like a toggle, perhaps on a middle-button popup in the message display window, that goes back and forth to TTY display mode (fixed pitch font, 8 space tabs, perhaps automatically extending the window how to a a minimum of 72 or 80 spaces).  I'd also like the hardcopy of a message being displayed in such a mode to be in TTY mode also (recall my earlier request to have a hardcopy button attached to the message display window as well as the browser).  But the hardcopy toggle should of course be available for messages not being displayed, as an option in the wished for middle-button subcommand pop-up on the browser hardcopy button.--Ron*start*00649 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 22 Mar 84 11:21 PSTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Re: Lisp: response to ar 170In-reply-to: Burton.pa's message of 21 Mar 84 16:49 PSTTo: Burton.pacc: LispSupport.paIf the display clipping region is temporarily reset, the WIDTH and HEIGHT is *NOT* "the height and width of the interior of the window" but are the relevant values for the current clipping region.

This is a problem that exists right now.  Monitor locking wouldn't do any good here; DEdit will have to be rewritten so that different instances of DEdit do not fight over global state.  (2)  You can't run multiple instances of the compiler at once.

By the time we have a preemtive scheduler, I would think that ideally we should restructure the compiler so that it does not depend upon global state, but a shorter-term solution might be to monitor-lock the global state the compiler uses, so that different instances wait for each other instead of jumping all over each other.-- Tayloe.*start*00279 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 21 Mar 84 17:30 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: your listIn-reply-to: Stansbury.pa's message of 19 Mar 84 13:59 PSTTo: Stansbury.pacc: MASINTER.PA, lispsupport.PAdid these get turned into ARs?*start*00571 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date:  8 MAR 84 22:28 PSTFrom: MASINTER.PASubject: bug in "change" translation fixedTo:   LispSupportcc:   Maxwell, Card, WallaceThere was a bug in the "change" translation package where (change (fetch FOO X) --) without the "of" noise word was not translated properly (it assumed that the 3rd element of the "fetch" was the token OF and always used the 4th element).I have now fixed this in <LispCore>Sources>RECORD.

After wasting an hour trying to debug the situation, I discovered that even though FUM had a binding for FOO, that the compiled code had the constant value instead of the the value that was passed in.The glitch (actually, it is really a bug, given how much energy and time it can waste) is that the compiler doesn't print out a warning when it discovers this inconsistent use of the name FOO, the way it does when you attempt to bind a global or RESETVARS a non-global.I think a check for this case should be executed whenever code for binding a variable is compiled.--Ron *start*00819 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 22 Mar 84 20:23 PSTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Lisp: SINGLEFILEINDEX bugTo: LispSupport.pa, JonL, TongLisp-System-Date: 20-Mar-84 18:25:18Machine-Type: DoradoWith the new SINGLEFILEINDEX loaded, if I do(LISTFILES FOO) I immediately get back a value of NIL.If I don't have it loaded,(LISTFILES FOO)takes a while but then returns the value({PHYLUM}<FUM>FOO.;1).In other words, loading singlefileindex makes the value of LISTFILES be incorrect.I don't know if this was true in the old singlefileindex, but it is a glitch that should be fixed.Also, presumably, the singlefileindex process should be responsible for removing the file from NOTLISTEDFILES when it successfully completes.

This means that you can switch back and forth between different editting activities and between editting and parsing.  You can also have several rule or lexicon editting activities going on at the same time, and switch between them by clicking the mouse in the process you want to go to.  It is also possible to copy information from one editor to another via the copy-select mechanism (holding the shift key down).  Finally, you can now scroll up and down in these editting windows.When the system starts up there is one rule window and one lexicon window, in their usual positions on the screen.  However, the interface for invoking an editor is slightly different.  The LEFT and MIDDLE buttons will both initiate an editting, whereas it used to be the case that LEFT caused an item to be printed without starting up an editor.  Now, whatever is shown in one of these windows is available for editting.The difference between LEFT and MIDDLE is this:  If you click with MIDDLE on a word or category, the system will always prompt you for a region on the screen to set up a new editting window, leaving existing editting processes alone.If you click with LEFT, the system will re-use an existing window that does not have an un-installed change in it.  If the text in the window has been editted but you haven't installed it with ^X or aborted the edit with ^D, then the window will not be re-used.  Only if all editting windows are in this tentative state will you be asked for a new window region.This may cause your screen to get cluttered with editting windows.  To clear it, merely click in the title region of a window you want to get rid of, and select the "Close" command.  The window will become invisible, but it will be opened again and re-used the next time you click LEFT and there is no other available window to edit in.As before, typing ^X to a window installs the rule or lexical entry, and puts the TTY back to the toplevel input window.  Typing ^D stops the current editting, putting the TTY back to the toplevel input window, marking the lexicon window available for re-use.The editting commands are very similar to the previous configuration.  The one notable difference is that now text doesn't get deleted when it is shown white on black and you release the mouse button.  Instead it remains inverted on the screen until you hit the DEL (or DELETE on dlion) key, or until you start to type in some replacement text.  This might be a little confusing at first.Please report any bugs or problems, and also please tell make suggestions for different ways of managing the LEFT/MIDDLE selections if you find this clumsy or difficult to use.--Ron*start*01197 00071 UU @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Date: 23 Mar 84 11:39 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Undelivered mail?In-reply-to: Kaplan.pa's message of 20 Mar 84 21:03 PSTTo: TEditSupport.pacc: Halvorsen, Kaplan.pa, Burton, LafiteSupport.paKris also reported a bug like this a long time ago.The problem is a bug in the Text device's method for PEEKBIN.  At least in the case I observed, if \TEXTPEEKBIN is called when COFFSET=CBUFSIZE, i.e., when it is time to "turn the page", or in Tedit's case, go for the next piece, it sets CBUFSIZE for the next piece one too small, which means that the last character of the piece gets dropped, which often happens to be the last character of an address.TeditSupport: if you'd like a nice reproducible case, do the following: Forward a random message (say this one).  In the cc: field, where it says, say, "cc: Sybalsky.pa", replace "Sybalsky" by shift-selecting some other address out of the forwarded message, say "Burton".  Break the function \SENDMESSAGE2 and deliver the message.  The recipients as parsed by Lafite are an argument to that function, and you can see where the character was dropped.	Bill
