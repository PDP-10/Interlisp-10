However, this algorithm seems to not work particularly well, leaving the display in a fairly awkward state in a variety of ways.''The test case I had was to have a fairly long function, and scrolled down it quite a bit. In DEDIT, I did  a BREAK. Then, outside DEDIT, I called (UNBREAK) which modified the function but doesn''t call MARKASCHANGED. When I then touch the break expression (e.g., with a shift-select), it attempts to reformat the display but muddled it.''It might have been that the expression was partially or totally underlined/selected, which may be relevant.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 12-Jul-84 11':28':24Attn: SheilAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Programming EnvironmentSubsystem: Code EditorMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
