Please reply courteously to Eric@SRI-KL that unfortunately, DOSTATS doesn''t work on the 1108 in the current implementation; we would like to have it working by the next major release of Interlisp-D but that it is hard and behind a number of other major DLion microcode tasks.'...'Bill': can you elaborate what needs to get done to put stats into the 1108. I understand that it might be hard, but what else besides the modifications to the microcode needs to get done? Do you have a design? If so, can you append it to this AR?
