I''ll try to clarify.'I''d like an opcode that would generate a mask bitmap for use with BITBLT.  As you point out, that would afford the most flexibility for (maybe) the least microcode.  As for the type of polygons to be filled':  normal closed polygons would be easiest, and seem to be the most common case.''		Herb''-----''Date': 29 MAR 84 18':27 PST'From': JONL.PA'Subject': Re': Lisp': Wanted':  DLion area-fill microcode'To':   Jellinek, LispSupport'cc':   Lichtenberg.wbst, JONL, Burton''In response to the message sent  27 Mar 84 14':14 PST from Jellinek.pa''I''m not completely "up" on algorithms to do area filling, but I do know'of an application in ZetaLisp which uses triangulation -- namely it fills an'area under neath a curve by "coloring in" a lot of little triangles.''Maybe Burton or LIchtenberg.wbst has some knowledge about this?'''-----''Date': 29 Mar 84 18':40 PST'From': Jellinek.pa'Subject': Re': Lisp': Wanted':  DLion area-fill microcode'In-reply-to': JONL.PA''s message of 29 MAR 84 18':27 PST'To': JONL.PA'cc': Jellinek.PA, LispSupport.PA, Lichtenberg.wbst, Burton.PA''Hmm.
