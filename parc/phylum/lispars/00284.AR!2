If I do this with just one screen image it seems to work just fine (or at least I get the [No response from...] message), but if I do a bunch of HARDCOPYWs in a row something seems to get all clogged up, and all the background print jobs go into breaks, saying that the host isn''t available, or some such thing.  Why is this?  It seems to me it should all work okay.  I would like to put in a request for an extra arg or something so that I can keep HARDOPYW from doing a BLOCK, and avoid having to save images on files.  Or is there someway to do this now?'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 26-Mar-84 12':30':42Attn: vanMelle.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: NS ProtocolsMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: IntermittentImpact: ModeratePriority: HopefullyStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files:
