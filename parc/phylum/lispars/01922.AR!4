Since then, while'reading/loading files from Genie (at random times and files I believe)'we get the following printed in the prompt window':''File server broke connection while reading <file> at byte 6384...'Reopening file and restoring fileptr...done''Then it goes into a break of some form.  This happens when loading'compiled files, source files, and just when reading (we have our own'loader for knowledge bases that essentially is just a read s-expr loop).'The significant thing is that the byte is ALWAYS 6384.  I can also close'the file in the break, revert to the load, and redo it and everything is'fine (e.g. the load is successful).''This was first noticed by me when loading up a KEE system from the file'server yesterday.  Later it happened when I was again loading up a KEE'system but on different files (the files themselves hadn''t changed).  It'could be something we''re doing, but I''m not sure what it would be.''Oh yes, on errors which broke BSPBIN the ERRCODE was always'MARK.ENCOUNTERED.  Hope that helps.''Martin'-------'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 22-Aug-84 14':03':18
