You could probably elimiate the "Confirm" under the'	   InstallLispTool (since the user obviously bugged this option and'	   the "Remote Boot" tool itself has a Quit! command in case it *was*'	   an accident.''	   There should be a "Copy&amp;Start" and "Copy Only" command instead of'	   the single Start command.  This would eliminate the need for the'	   last "Confirm" asking the user if he/she wants to start the volume'	   after the copy.  (P.S.  I am aware that you *can* click ahead but'	   it is a nusance nevertheless.)''							Jeff'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JFung.pasaEdit-Date: 22-May-84  9':41':13Attn: ReleaseAssigned To: JFung.pasaIn/By: Disposition: System: Other SoftwareSubsystem: Machine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: HopefullyStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - ImplSource Files: </pre>
