Right now, there''s a type definition language that just Lispifies the Mesa-like type syntax of the Courier spec. The Courier code does conversion *at run time* between the packed Mesa types on the network and the list structure equivalent inside Lisp. If the definition language were changed to declare appropriate MesaTypes, we could get by with only BLTing the bits around; the Lisp functions that talk to NS servers could use the MesaType records directly.''By the way, I think we should pick a different name than MesaTypes, which makes it sound too connected with Mesa. How about SystemRecords or PackedRecords?''						Eric'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 18-Jul-84 18':09':35Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: CommunicationsSubsystem: NS ProtocolsMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: ModeratePriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: PerformanceSource Files: </pre>
