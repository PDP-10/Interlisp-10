Sooner or later there has got to be a way from within Lisp to manipulate files for which there is no LITATOM representation of the name.  ''When that time comes, TEdit is going to need a way to specify a filename by, say, a STRINGP.  Is it really all that useful now for TEdit''s first arg to be entered in the buffer when it is a STRINGP?  I.e., why type the data as a string argument?  Why not just get an "empty" file and type the string in directly to the editor?  Coercion to textobj''s could be used when a functional interface is required.''-----''Date': 17 Aug 84 20':58 PDT'From': Masinter.pa'Subject': AR#19, Numeric file names don''t work'To': LispSupport, vanMelle, JonL, Kaplan''The specific cases listed in this AR now work, and so I''ve marked the AR as fixed ("Assigned To': vanMelle" since I think Bill fixed them.)
