I can''t replicate this in the current sysout; see if you can, and/or if you can replicate it in Fugue.4.  For a test case, you can do something like''_(SETQ MYFUNNYNAME 1)''_(PROCESS.EVAL ''MOUSE ''(ADD1 MYFUNYNAME))''and see if you can answer the question that pops up in the new mouse window, "MYFUNYNAME -> MYFUNNYNAME ?"''-----''Date':  2 Apr 84 13':38 PST'From': Kiewiet.pasa'Subject': Re': AR#439': DWIM questions in mouse process can''t be answered'In-reply-to': vanMelle.pa''s message of 2 Apr 84 12':02 PST'To': vanMelle.pa'cc': 1100Support.pa, LispSupport.pa''Thanks, Bill, for the speedy reply.
