There was a bug in the device event behavior (which gets invoked to clean things up across logouts, sysouts, etc.) which was preventing the file system from properly reinitializing its internal records of the lisp file directory, thus causing other error checking code to conclude that there was no lisp volume on the disk.

Here is how the bug can be produced':  Do a (MKDIR ''DSK) on a new system that has a logical volume DSK (by the way, my DSK is the last volume on the disk, after LISP), create a few files onto {DSK} and then LOGOUT while you are connected to DSK (so far so good).  When you reboot LISP you get MP':9305 (which you can exit from Tele-Raid via ^d) but then LISP complains that "There is no directory on DSK" and all the DLionFS remedial procedures (SCAVENGEVOLUME, MKDIR etc. ) end up with MP':9318.  Also, the logical volume remains of type "non-pilot"  and any scavenging operation (from Hello) is useless.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: StansburyEdit-Date: 11-Sep-84 15':25':32
