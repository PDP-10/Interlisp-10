It is not'working at all like I would expect.  I seems that it places repeating'bitmaps at fixed intervals regardless of the bitmap size.  It also'seems to take seemingly random cross sections of the given bitmap'(there is a line in the manual that alludes to something about'"intersections of the tiles" with a texture argument but I haven''t'been able to figure out what that means.)''	To me it would seem logical that if I wanted a (4 on, 2'off) dashed line of thickness 2 I would use a 6 x 6 bitmap that looked'like':''XXOOOO'XXOOOO'XXOOOO'XXOOOO'OOXXXX'OOXXXX''	It doesn''t work.''	Can patterned lines be drawn and how would I do it (aside from'using DRAWCURVE to do a straight line)?''							Jeff'-------'Date': 18 Mar 84 22':48 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': BITBLTing using a bitmap as a texture'In-reply-to': Jeffrey Shulman <SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA>''s message of 13 Feb 84 13':48':00 EST'To': SHULMAN@RUTGERS'cc': lispsupport.pa''I believe the only requirement on the bitmap is that its width be 16.  Its height can be anything.  If you have a narrower texture, replicate it yourself out to 16 wide.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 14-Jun-84 15':10':36Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: Impact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: DocumentationSource Files:
