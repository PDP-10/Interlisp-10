[DSPVTS is the functional support for Virtual Terminal Service'    under the Interlisp-D windowworld -- has functions like DSPINSCHAR for'    "inserting" a character, DSPDELLINE for "deleting" a line.  Remember also'    that DSPCLEOL is in the system now, for "Clear-to-end-of-line"]'    Sometime ago I asked Beau for an estimate of priority of the converto-to'    RS232C port; that conversion should clear up the dropped character problem.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 13-Apr-84 14':49':52Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: '[Date': 13 Apr 84 00':08 PST'From': JonL.pa'Subject': AR 386'To': LispSupport''Pleas mark this one "Declined", in favor of routing RS232 traffic through the RS232C port.
