(I delete messags that do not seem interesting before I read them.)  Personal mail is usually more important than DL mail.  How about a command to set the marker character of DL mail with an ^?  I suppose this would only involve comparing the "To" and "Cc" fields with my name and flagging if they didn''t match.  Perhaps some sort of exceptions list could be included, so important DL mail would not be flagged?''-------'Date':  8 Jun 84 20':50 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa''There have been a number of requests for some sort of programmatic feature to filter incoming mail and do various things with it, such as sort it into different folders.  Your request could be considered a special case of that, where you want personal messages into a priority 1 bucket and everything else in a lower priority bucket.  I''ve entered an AR on this for the record, but I have no immediate plans to implement such a thing.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Edit-Date: 11-Jun-84 13':38':16Attn: vanMelleAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: HardFrequency: EverytimeImpact: AnnoyingPriority: UnlikelyStatus: OpenProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
