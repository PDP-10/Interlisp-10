Number: 1093Date: 11-May-84 16':40':35Submitter: JellinekSource: JellinekSubject: Typo in HASHOVERFLOW in MACHINEINDEPENDENTLisp Version:  9-May-84 09':41':34Description: HASHOVERFLOW was rehashing into a hash array created using HARRAY instead of HASHARRAY.  Under the "new" hash array regime, this has the effect of giving the new array the overflow property ERROR, regardless of its previous setting.  Thus, a given HARRAYP would only overflow once successfully; the next time would cause a HASH ARRAY FULL error.Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 17-Aug-84  9':52':28Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: Fixed.  Changed HASHOVERFLOW to call HASHARRAY instead of HARRAY.System: Operating SystemSubsystem: OtherMachine: 1100Disk: Microcode Version: 5121Memory Size: 4096File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: EasyFrequency: EverytimeImpact: SeriousPriority: AbsolutelyStatus: ClosedProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
