We have made about 6 attempts and HEINLEIN consistently drops into a mode which causes the error message HEINLEIN': filing not responding at some point during the transfer.  (A particularly annoying instance was during the first try when Heinlein gobbled up 7300  pages before it decided to take a break.  Restarting ether and similar moves doesn''t help.''Does anybody have any idea what this behavior is indicative of, and whether there is a fix for it?''------''Date':  3 May 84 17':53 PDT'From': Cooper.pa'Subject': NS fileserver trouble at CSLI'To': Masinter'cc': vanMelle, Kaplan, LispSupport, Cooper''Ron told me again today about the (repeatable) trouble they were having copying a sysout from their TOPS20 to their NS fileserver.''I suggested that it might be the slow rate at which pages were being stored onto the NS fileserver, and asked them to try a similar size copy directly from a floppy to the NS fileserver. Sure enough, that works OK.''This is a longstanding problem with the NS fileservers. The trouble is that they expect you to provide the bulk data during a Filing.Store operation promptly. If you dribble it in, the fileserver gives up on you. The underlying SPP connection is still active; when the fileserver probes us to see if we''re there, we respond promptly. The problem is that at a higher level somewhere in the fileserver code, it times out file transfers.''This is a gross mismatch with the way Lisp expects things to work (DRIBBLE files, computing results directly to files, and so on.) This should be sent as an AR to the Filing implementors. Could someone adept at inter-organization communication please see to this?''This and further discussion should be added to the Lisp AR on the sysout problem.''						Eric'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: MasinterEdit-Date: </pre>
