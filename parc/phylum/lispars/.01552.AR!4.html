In the past, I''ve set aside some text to be printed as GACHA 10, but everytime I try to print it, it comes out in "Modern" with a message "Font ''Modern'' substitued for ''Gacha''" on the cover sheet.  It should have substituted Terminal according to the FONTPROFILE.  Then I realized that according to the FONTPROFILE, DEFAULTFONT displays on the screen as GACHA 10, and on an Interpress printer as TERMINAL 8.  That is, when going to the printer, it doesn''t substitute TERMINAL for every instance of GACHA, but rather for every instance of DEFAULTFONT.''The problem here is that the way to specify a font in TEdit is by "GACHA," not "DEFAULTFONT."  I think what we have here is a rather misleading situation.  Is there some way to tell TEdit everytime it''s sending a font change off to Interpress to use Terminal for Gacha, Modern for Helvetica, etc.?  Or is this an Interpress problem rather than TEdit?''--Ken.''-----'mjs 6/28''Subject': Re': TEdit': Fonts for printing'In-reply-to': Feuerman.pasa''s message of 27 Jun 84 11':14 PDT'To': Feuerman.pasa'cc': TEditSupport''I think that this is a problem with Interpress, and with fonts in general.  FONTPROFILE is an ancient hack that should be totally revamped.''-----''Fonts and fontprofiles have been completely revamped.  Fontclasses have been introduced as a first-class font-object that can be given to CHANGEFONT, DSPFONT, FONTCREATE, etc.  DFSPFONT can be applied to Font classes, and CHANGEFONT can be applied to things like ''(GACHA 10).  (In fact, DSPFONT and CHANGEFONT are now exact synonyms in D--a MOVD is done).''Also, the coercions of font names from inside Interlisp-D to a reasonable set of corresponding fonts on particular printers is now done better and more uniformly.''Still a problem':  TERMINAL 10 doesn''t exist on Interpress printers.''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 19-Sep-84 18':43':02</pre>
