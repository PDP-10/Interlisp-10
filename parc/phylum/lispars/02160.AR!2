There''s a bug in how the SELECTIONFN is called. I have a patch for the buggy function \ITEM.WINDOW.SELECTION.HANDLER in a file'{ivy}<MITTAL>LISP>INSPECT-PATCH''2. If the PROPPRINTFN returns something different than what the prop name is, then the value for that prop is printed on the next line, shifted to the left (as opposed to the same line).''Suggestions':'1. If PROPPRINTFN returns a string, it should be printed without the ""s.''2. I would like to get more control over the Selection protocol, i.e., NOT have the system insist on selection by left button and commands by middle button. This could, probably be easily, done by having the VALUCOMMANDFN and PROPCOMMANDFN called whenever a value/prop was selected by a middle button INSTEAD of only when they had already been selected.''I have been using INSPECTW.CREATE not really as an inspector BUT rather as a means to get a two-column menu, where there is a correspondence between elements in the two columns. Other than the bugs and problem with middle button selection, it has worked out very nicely (in conjunction with the ATTACHEDWINDOW package).'--Sanjay''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 12-Sep-84 14':07':01
