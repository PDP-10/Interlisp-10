After sticking a date object in your document, a process would run periodically that updated the date in your document window.  Are there facilities for having an object update its image even though Tedit didn''t ask it to do anything?''Can you think of other uses for such a capability?''Anybody want to take a crack at the date object?''--Ron'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: SybalskyEdit-Date: 10-May-84 13':57':30
