''1) TIMEALL still seems to have a bug in it where it charges SWAP time to CPU.   Two runs of the famous FFT benchmark, which should have been identical except for SWAP and gc boundary conditions, showed the same GC time (about 3.2 secs of each), but one was charged 1.56 secs CPU and no SWAP, while the other was charged 2.27 secs CPU and only .157 swap.  Looks to me like there is a *gross* lossage in accounting for the SWAP time.  Is there an AR on this one?''-- JonL --'''Date': 30 Aug. 1982 4':44 pm PDT (Monday)'From': Raim.EOS'Subject': BREAKDOWN'To': LispSupport.pa'cc': Raim''Because the Dolphin CPU "runs" during keyboard IO waits, a large bundle of'CPU time get ascribed to interactive functions by BREAKDOWN thereby'obscuring the real costs.''One user, Darrel Van Buer, has patched the problem by including \BACKGROUND in the functions being monitored and then manually ignoring that entry.
