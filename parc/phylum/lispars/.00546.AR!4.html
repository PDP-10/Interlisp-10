Nevertheless, the lossages occurred in between scrollings,'and didn''t seem to be connected with them.''I believe i had called SHAPEW to place the window''s bottom line on line 16'of the SCREENBITMAP (Which probably shouldn''t make any difference but . . .)''-----''Date': 10 Apr 84 10':35 PST'From': Burton.pa'Subject': Re': AR 546': CLEAR doesn''t always clear bottom line of borderless window'In-reply-to': JONL.PA''s message of 9 APR 84 19':21 PST'To': JONL.PA'cc': Burton.PA, LispSupport.PA''There was a bug in the caret code for a few days that put bits in the border region of the window.

I never made this borderless window a TTYDISPLAYSTREAM for anyone.  Only got the bits there via Paint window command and bitbltting the whole region of the screen up by one pixel -- i.e., the scrolling test passed along by Peter.  However, the lossage was noticeable after doing a successfule Clear command, and just painting, and trying Clear again.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: masinter.PAEdit-Date: 11-Apr-84 15':41':04Attn: Burton.paAssigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: Windows and GraphicsSubsystem: Window SystemMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: Frequency: IntermittentImpact: AnnoyingPriority: PerhapsStatus: OpenProblem Type: BugSource Files: </pre>
