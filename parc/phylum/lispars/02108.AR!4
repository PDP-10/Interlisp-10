You can''t print the info starting at some absolute column number unless you do what the TAB function does':  specify a minimum amount of white space between the end of the name and the column (e.g. a space), and if you can''t get that much, either move the info over, or print the info in the proper column but one line down.'Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: JellinekEdit-Date: 16-Sep-84 13':28':16
