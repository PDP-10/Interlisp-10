You don''t have to reset it on every block, just when you lose or regain the tty.  This is what the TTYENTRYFN and TTYEXITFN properties are for; they are used by Tedit and Chat, for example, to disable and reenable interrupts.  Ideally, both KEYACTION and INTERRUPTCHAR should be part of something like a Mesa Tip Table, and every process has its own Tip Table, automatically set when the process gains the tty.''Independent of those considerations, I would say hacking Tab with KEYACTION in Dedit is not right anyway.  It means you can''t type a real tab to Dedit (a small point, but you might want one in a string, for example).  I have a similar complaint about the various control-character reader macros in Dedit, which do the right thing at the start of a line, but whose definition prevents you from using them as a legitimate part of typein.  My recommendation back when I was hacking the Dedit input code to remove most of the tab and readmacro glitches was that the infamous Peekc bug be fixed.  With that bug out of the way, you could handle all your special keys with PEEKC.''<can''t type a tab here>Bill''-----''Date':  9 MAY 84 15':59 PDT'From': ROACH.PA'Subject': Workaround for DEDIT TAB problem'To':   LISPSUPPORT''     I''ve put (MOVD ''NILL ''DEDITTABSON) & (MOVD ''NILL ''DEDITTABSOFF)'in my init file.'				Kelly''-----''Date': 16 Aug 84 11':38 PDT'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': Get''s into a tabless mood.'In-reply-to': Shrager.pa''s message of 15 Aug 84 20':29 PDT'To': Shrager.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa''There is a bug in DEdit (not Tedit) that steals away your tabs.
