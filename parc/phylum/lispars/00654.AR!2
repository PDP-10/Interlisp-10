"Mousing" in the leftmost columns of the browser either selects the message, or bring up a scheduled prompter to input a character for the "prefix"; typically I''m "mousing ahead" of myself, and many seconds go by before I even notice that an attempted msg selection has aborted into a prompt request.''How about some very thin, maybe dotted, vertical line separating the two columns?''-----''Date': 12 Apr 84 11':46 PST'From': vanMelle.pa'Subject': Re': Lafite': Leftmost columns of browser indistinguishable, but mousing has drastically different effects'In-reply-to': JonL.pa''s message of 11 Apr 84 17':18 PST'To': JonL.pa'cc': LafiteSupport.pa''You may not be aware (many Laurel users aren''t) that Lafite lets you select messages anywhere in the browser window, not just in the left margin.  If you stay away from the left margin, you won''t have this problem at all.  I''ll make a note to explain this more explicitly in the documentation.  Also, I think the feedback for selecting in the mark region is quite adequate.  So all things considered, I am reluctant to clutter up the browser window with an extra boundary line.''Status': Declined.''Workaround: Test Case: Edit-By: Sannella.PAEdit-Date: 13-Apr-84 12':32':12Attn: Assigned To: In/By: Disposition: System: TextSubsystem: LafiteMachine: Disk: Microcode Version: Memory Size: File Server: Server Software Version: Difficulty: ModerateFrequency: Impact: Priority: HopefullyStatus: DeclinedProblem Type: Design - UISource Files:
