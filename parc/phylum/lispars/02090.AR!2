I don''t know why they didn''t show up under the old chat, actually.  Bill will probably know more.''   Second, Bill asserts that the chatwindow is the natural place for messages.  I tend to agree in light of the current overuse of the prompt window (I sort of like JonL''s suggestion for a separate error stream which would usually go to a scrollable window), and since these msgs should be rare occurances that the user needs to see.''	-- Rich''-----''Date': 24 Sep 84 15':56 PDT'From': burton.pa'Subject': Chat error msg in chat window'To':  VanMelle'cc': LispSupport.pa''In the <lispcore>next> loadup of sept 21, my chat window was getting the error message "[PUP error in CHAT connection]Port IQ full" appearing in the middle of the chat typescript window.
