MATHTONSTad Hogg  (Hogg.pa)This file defines the translation array needed to convert from the Press MATH font to corresponding NS characters. This allows documents containing the MATH font to be printed on Interpress printers.The array \MATHTONSARRAY contains the translations for most of the characters. Some may not be available on particular printers, causing them to appear as black boxes.
