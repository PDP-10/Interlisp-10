The goal of the ArchiveTool is to make the multi-step archiving process as simple and as automatic as possible, approximating the functionality that was available on the old Maxc archive system.   The ArchiveTool supports only the archiving of files on IFS's.  ArchiveTool also provides the functionality of the old LispUsers module ArchiveBrowser which is a file browser like tool for examining the Archive.Directory file created by the Cedar Archive tool.THE CEDAR  ARCHIVE SYSTEMThe Cedar Archive system is built around the Grapevine mail system.  To archive a file from a file server, you send mail to Archivist.pa.  When the file has been archived, Archivist.pa sends you back a message listing the files archived, where they were archived, and any problems that were encountered.  If you have specified Archive and Delete, the archivist will delete the files.  Otherwise it  is up to you, the user, to delete the archived files from the file server.   To retrieve an archived file, you must send Archivist.pa a message stating the file and its archive location.  Use the ArchiveBrowser as described below.Documentation on the Cedar Archive system can be found on {Cyan}<Archivist>documentation>ArchiveDoc.ip.THE XEROX LISP ARCHIVETOOLThe ArchiveTool provides an interface to both the sending of archive requests to Archivist.pa,  an interface to browsing archived files and sending of retrieval requests to Archivist.pa.  Requesting an archiveThe ArchiveTool is based on the FileBrowser library module.  When the ArchiveTool is loaded, a new command, Archive, is added to the FileBrowser menu.To archive some files, bring up a FileBrowser that includes those files (i.e., FileBrowser on the directory containing the files).  Select the files and then choose the Archive command in the FileBrowser menu.  The Archive menu item has a slide-out menu.  If you choose Archive (without sliding out) then a Archive request will be sent.  If you use the slide-out menu, you have four options:  Archive,  Archive ALL Files,  Archive and Delete, and Archive and Delete ALL Files.Archive	[Menu Item]Archive selected files  keeping them on the file serverArchive ALL Files	[Menu Item]Archive all files in the file browser keeping them on the file server.Archive and Delete	[Menu Item]The selected files are archived then deleted from the file server.Archive and Delete ALL Files	[Menu Item]All files in the file browser are archived then deleted.Notes:The deletion will be performed after the file has been archived.  Do not delete the files yourself.  If you choose one of the "ALL" commands,  wildcarded pattern will be sent to the archivist - not the list of every file in the file browser.Choosing one of these choices will automatically compose an archive request message to Archivist.pa in the form of a mail message.  Hit deliver to send the message.Note that only files on an IFS can be archived .  You cannot archive local disk files, files on a Vax, files on NS file servers, Sun file server or Symbolics files servers.Also note that "Cedar rules for file names govern what names the Archivist will accept, and they are more restrictive than IFS.  The important point is that . $ - + are the ONLY non-alphanumeric characters allowed in file names.  You may not use & # @ or anything else and expect the Archivist to swallow them".   ArchiveTool will let you know about files with invalid character names in them.   It will ask you if you want to rename the files such that all bad characters will be substituted with a $.  Any files that aren't renamed won't be skipped (i.e. not included in the request for archiving).For more information on using the FileBrowser see the Lisp Library documentation.User Settable ParametersArch.CcToSelfFlg	[Variable] if the global variable Arch.CcToSelfFlg is non-NIL, then copies of your archive request messages will be CCed to you.  If Arch.CcToSelfFlg is NIL, the archive request will not be Cced to you. Default setting is T.Arch.VerifyNotArchivedFlg	[Variable]if Arch.VerifyNotArchivedFlg is set to T then all files requested to be archived will be compared against the Archive.Directory.  Files that have already been archived will not be rearchived.  Default setting is NIL.  The lookup in Archive.Directory can take a little while if the Archive.Directory is reasonable large.Requesting a retrievalAfter some delay (a few days to a few weeks), Archivist.pa will return to you a mail message containing a listing of the files that were archived.  The archivist will also write into the file Archive.Directory.  Life will be easier if you do NOT  delete this file.  Use the retrieve command using Archive Browser (see below).Archive BrowserIn order to browse an archive directory, you can either choose ArchiveBrowser off the background menu or else make a programmatic call to the archive browser.There are only two functions which you need be aware of(ARCHIVEBROWSER  archivefilespec filter)	[Function](AB  archivefilespec filter)	[NLambda Function]The archivefilespec argument is defaulted to the file server and top-level directory from your LOGINHOST/DIR, with a default file name of Archive.Directory.  You may override this by specifying either a directory or a complete file name.The filter argument is defaulted to the pattern "*.*".  You may specify any other pattern at invocation or you may use the Filter command (see below)The ARCHIVEBROWSER and AB functions correspond to the FILEBROWSER and FB functions, and may be used in a similar way.OPERATIONThe commands to the archive browser are given via the command menu attached to the righthand side of the browser.  It is quite similar to the FileBrowser in style.  The commands dealing with particular files operate on the selected items in the browser.The file names displayed in the browser are printed as they appear in the archive directory file, which is written by the Archivist, and consequently use the [host] notation rather than {host}.SelectionsSelections are made with the mouse buttons:  Left indicates a single selection (and cancels any previous selections), Middle indicates an additional selection, and Right will extend a selection if there is only a single entry already selected.  Items may be deselected with the Middle button when the CTRL key (Dorado) or PROP'S key (Dandelion and Daybreak) is depressed.  (Note that due to the coding in the TableBrowser package the deselection is hardwired to the given key, not that to which the user has assigned the Control function.)CommandsThere are a number of blank items in the menu.  These items do nothing and are present only to separate seldom used or dangerous commands from commonly used ones.Retrieve	[Menu Item]The Retrieve command will generate a retrieve request for any files selected in the browser.  Files are retrieved with the same name as they were archived with, however the version number may change when the file is restored.  The Retrieve command has alternate forms available as rollout menu subitems:Retrieve selected files	[Menu Subitem]Same as the top-level Retrieve command.Retrieve to directory	[Menu Subitem]Retrieve to directory  prompts for a directory name and will retrieve the selected files into the specified directory.Retrieve renamed	[Menu Subitem]Retrieve renamed prompts for a new name for each of the selected files and requests retrieval with this name.Filter	[Menu Item]The Filter command allows specification of a pattern that can be used to restrict the files shown in the browser.  The default pattern is "*.*" which matches all files.Sort	[Menu Item]The Sort command reorders the files presented in the browser.  The default sort is in alphabetical order by filename.  Other orders are available as rollout menu subitems:Sort by file name	[Menu Subitem]Same as top level Sort command.Sort by creation date	[Menu Subitem]Sort by creation date sorts the files in order of decreasing creation date.Sort by archive date	[Menu Subitem]Sort by archive date returns the files to the order in which they were first displayed when the browser was opened.  The archive date is not actually recorded, but is implicit in the order of entries in the archive directory file.Reverse	[Menu Subitem]Reverse will reverse the order of the items in the browser.  Recompute	[Menu Item]The Recompute command causes the archive directory file to be read anew and the items to be redisplayed.Same directory	[Menu Subitem]Same as  top level Recompute command.New directory	[Menu Subitem]The New Directory subcommand prompts for a directory from where it will read an archive directory file.  If only a directory is given (no filename) then the name "Archive.Directory" will automatically be supplied.Delete	[Menu Item]The Delete command marks the selected items in the browser for later deletion.  Note that deleting items from the archive directory file does not actually free up archive tape space, but does mean that you won't be able to retrieve the file.  You probably shouldn't use this unless you have a lot of items which you are absolutely sure you will never need again.Undelete	[Menu Item]Undelete unmarks the selected items which had previously been marked by the Delete command.Undelete all items	[Menu Subitem]Undelete all items removes the deletion marks from all items in the browser.Expunge	[Menu Item]The Expunge command removes the items in the browser previously marked for deletion, and writes a new version of the archive directory file.  Should you happen to delete and expunge by mistake you can delete the new archive directory file (highest version)  reverting to the previous version.     (LIST ((PAGE NIL NIL (0 0 17 22) ((TEXT NIL NIL (72 72 468 648) NIL))) (PAGE NIL NIL (0 0 17 22) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 SIZE 10 FAMILY GACHA OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM)) (468 756 72 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (72 72 468 648) NIL))) (PAGE NIL NIL (0 0 17 22) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 SIZE 10 FAMILY GACHA OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM)) (468 756 72 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (72 72 468 648) NIL)))))      	 2    È        È                   T     )    È                       T     .    È      È                         1    È        È                         (    È                             (    È                             ( Š Š8                             ( Š Š8                              D    È        È       PAGEHEADING RUNNINGHEAD                      	HELVETICA 
