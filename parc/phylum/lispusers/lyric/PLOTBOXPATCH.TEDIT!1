PLOTBOXPATCHTad Hogg (hogg.pa)This file redefines the plot functions BOXREGION and DRAWPLOT so that each side of the box around the plot need not be drawn. Specifically, giving a plot a non-NIL value for the properties NOLEFT, NORIGHT, NOTOP or NOBOTTOM will eliminate the respective side from the drawing of the plot.
