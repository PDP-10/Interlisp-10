REGISTER-MACHINEby Lanning, Briggs, MasinterThis utility was originally written by Stan Lanning and Nick Briggs;  I'm merely putting a cleaned up version on LispUsers.After loading in Register-Machine (.lcom), there'll be a new Lafite form under Send Mail labelled "Clearinghouse registry request". If you select it,  it will set up a mail message to ask your local system administrator to add your machine to the clearinghouse database.To: UserAdministration:PARCCc: Larry Masinter:PARC:xeroxReply-to: Larry Masinter:PARC:xeroxPrimary User:  Larry Masinter:PARC:xeroxName:  "LeParc"Network Number:     6Processor Number: 1-435-140-209Description:  A Dorado (typically running Lisp)Thank you.-- Larry- - - - - - - - - - - In Grapevine mail mode:To: UserAdministration.PARCCc: Masinter.paReply-to: Masinter.paPrimary User:  Masinter.paName:  "LeParc"Network Number:     6Processor Number: 1-435-140-209Description:  A Dorado (typically running Lisp)Thank you.-- Larry
