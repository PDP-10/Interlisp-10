PLOTANDNC-PATCHTad HoggPLOT and NOTECARDS each use a different format to store fonts on files. This can result in unreadable files if both these programs are loaded when a file is written but only one when it is read. For instance, if NOTECARDS is loaded after PLOT, fonts (e.g. those used in writing out a plot) will be written out using the NOTECARDS format. Such a file will not be readable in a sysout containing PLOT but not NOTECARDS (even though the file contains only a plot).This patch contains definitions for both READFONT (used by PLOT) and READ.FONTINTODESCRIPTOR (used by NOTECARDS) so that files will always be readable.</pre>
