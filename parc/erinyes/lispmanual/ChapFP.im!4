This terminology is confusing, because the word "file" is also used in the more conventional sense as meaning a collection of data stored some physical media.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to change this terminology at this time, because many functions and variables ({fn MAKEFILE}, {var FILEPKGTYPES}, etc.) incorporate the word "file" in their names.  Eventually, the system and the documentation will be revamped to consistantly use the term {index *PRIMARY* Modules}"module" or {index *PRIMARY* Definition groups}"definition group" or {index *PRIMARY* Defgroups}"defgroup."} {Include FPintro}{Include FPfns}{Include FPtypes}{Include FPcoms}{Include FPfilecoms}{Include FPformat}}{End Chapter File Package}
