Welcome to the IRM DInfo graph.This is the online version of the Interlisp Reference Manual (IRM).  Each chapter, section and sub-section of the IRM is represented here as a node in a DInfo graph.  DInfo provides the mechanism for browsing this graph.Most interaction with DInfo is done through the FreeMenu at the top of DInfo's window.  The following commands are useful for graph navigation:	Top! will always bring you back here, to the top node of the current graph.  Note that the name of the top node is printed next to the command button.	Parent! will bring you to the parent of the current node.	Previous! and Next! provide linear access to the graph.  Successive mousings of Next! will take you from the front to the back of the Interlisp Reference Manual.The Display: toggles control what information will be displayed and how.	Graph toggles display of the graph local to your current position.  Mousing a node in the graph will cause you visit that node.	Menu toggles display of a menu of the children of the current node.  Selecting an item from this menu will cause you to visit the subnode by that name.	Text toggles display of the text of each node.  Turning this off allows quick motion about the tree while searching for the appropriate documentation.	History toggles recording and display of the history of where you have been in the graph.  Selecting an item in the History menu will cause you to revisit that node.Lookup! and Find! have editable items to their right in the menu.  These items are initially empty, and hence invisible.	Lookup! will lookup the term to its right in the index of the IRM, and then bring you to the node containing this term.  Note that once you have started DInfo, all manual lookup is modified to work this way, i.e., the ?<CR> TTYIN macro and the HELP lispxmacro will use this facility.  Note also that "*" is a wildcard in lookup strings.	Find! will search for the string to its right in the text of the current node.
