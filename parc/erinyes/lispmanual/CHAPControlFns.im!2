Interlisp supplies a large number of predicates, conditional functions, and control functions.  Also, there is a complex "iterative statement" facility which allows the user to easily create complex loops and iterative constructs ({PageRef Tag IterativeStatement}).{Include Conditionals}{Include PROG}{Include IterativeStatements}}{End Chapter Conditionals and Iterative Statements}
