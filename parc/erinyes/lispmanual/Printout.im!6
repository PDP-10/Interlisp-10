By executing various sequences of {fn PRIN1}, {fn PRIN2}, {fn TAB}, {fn TERPRI}, {fn SPACES}, {fn PRINTNUM}, and {fn PRINTDEF}, almost any effect can be achieved.  {lisp PRINTOUT} implements a compact language for specifying complicated sequences of these elementary printing functions.  It makes fancy output formats easy to design and simple to program.{lisp PRINTOUT} is a CLISP word (like {lisp FOR} and {lisp IF}) for interpreting a special printing language in which the user can describe the kinds of printing desired.  The description is translated by {fn DWIMIFY} to the appropriate sequence of {fn PRIN1}, {fn TAB}, etc., before it is evaluated or compiled.  {lisp PRINTOUT} printing descriptions have the following general form:{lispcode (PRINTOUT {arg STREAM} {arg PRINTCOM{sub 1}} {ellipsis} {arg PRINTCOM{sub N}})}{arg STREAM} is evaluated to obtain the stream to which the output from this specification is directed.  The {lisp PRINTOUT} commands are strung together, one after the other without punctuation, after {arg STREAM}.  Some commands occupy a single position in this list, but many commands expect to find arguments following the command name in the list.  The commands fall into several logical groups:  one set deals with horizontal and vertical spacing, another group provides controls for certain formatting capabilities (font changes and subscripting), while a third set is concerned with various ways of actually printing items.  Finally, there is a command that permits escaping to a simple Lisp evaluation in the middle of a {lisp PRINTOUT} form.  The various commands are described below.  The following examples give a general flavor of how {lisp PRINTOUT} is used:Example 1:  Suppose the user wanted to print out on the terminal the values of three variables, {lisp X}, {lisp Y}, and {lisp Z}, separated by spaces and followed by a carriage return.  This could be done by:{lispcode(PRIN1 X T)(SPACES 1 T)(PRIN1 Y T)(SPACES 1 T)(PRIN1 Z T)(TERPRI T)}or by the more concise {lisp PRINTOUT} form:{lispcode (PRINTOUT T X , Y , Z T)}Here the first {lisp T} specifies output to the terminal, the commas cause single spaces to be printed, and the final {lisp T} specifies a {fn TERPRI}.  The variable names are not recognized as special {lisp PRINTOUT} commands, so they are printed using {fn PRIN1} by default.Example 2:  Suppose the values of {lisp X} and {lisp Y} are to be pretty-printed lined up at position 10, preceded by identifying strings.  If the output is to go to the primary output stream, the user could write either:{lispcode(PRIN1 "X =")(PRINTDEF X 10 T)(TERPRI )(PRIN1 "Y =")(PRINTDEF Y 10 T)(TERPRI)}or the equivalent:{lispcode(PRINTOUT NIL "X =" 10 .PPV X T   "Y =" 10 .PPV Y T)}Since strings are not recognized as special commands, {lisp "X ="} is also printed with {fn PRIN1} by default.  The positive integer means {fn TAB} to position 10, where the {lisp .PPV} command causes the value of {lisp X} to be prettyprinted as a variable.  By convention, special atoms used as {lisp PRINTOUT} commands are prefixed with a period.  The {lisp T} causes a carriage return, so the {lisp Y} information is printed on the next line.Example 3.  As a final example, suppose that the value of {lisp X} is an integer and the value of {lisp Y} is a floating-point number.  {lisp X} is to be printed right-flushed in a field of width 5 beginning at position 15, and {lisp Y} is to be printed in a field of width 10 also starting at position 15 with 2 places to the right of the decimal point.  Furthermore, suppose that the variable names are to appear in the font class named {lisp BOLDFONT} and the values in font class {lisp SMALLFONT}.  The program in ordinary Interlisp that would accomplish these effects is too complicated to include here.  With {lisp PRINTOUT}, one could write:{lispcode(PRINTOUT NIL   .FONT BOLDFONT "X =" 15   .FONT SMALLFONT .I5 X T   .FONT BOLDFONT "Y =" 15   .FONT SMALLFONT .F10.2 Y T   .FONT BOLDFONT)}The {lisp .FONT} commands do whatever is necessary to change the font on a multi-font output device.  The {lisp .I5} command sets up a {lisp FIX} format for a call to the function {fn PRINTNUM} ({PageRef Fn PRINTNUM}) to print {lisp X} in the desired format.  The {lisp .F10.2} specifies a {lisp FLOAT} format for {fn PRINTNUM}.{Begin SubSec Horizontal Spacing Commands}{Title Horizontal Spacing Commands}{TextThe horizontal spacing commands provide convenient ways of calling {fn TAB} and {fn SPACES}.

Note that nothing is done with the {it value} of {arg FORM}; any printing desired is accomplished by {arg FORM} itself, and the value is discarded.}}Note:  Although {lisp PRINTOUT} logically encloses its translation in a {fn RESETFORM} ({PageRef Fn RESETFORM}) to change the primary output file to the {arg FILE} argument (if non-{lisp NIL}), in most cases it can actually pass {arg FILE} (or a locally bound variable if {arg FILE} is a non-trivial expression) to each printing function.  Thus, the {fn RESETFORM} is only generated when the {lisp #} command is used, or user-defined commands (below) are used.  If many such occur in repeated {lisp PRINTOUT} forms, it may be more efficient to embed them all in a single {fn RESETFORM} which changes the primary output file, and then specify {arg FILE}={lisp NIL} in the {lisp PRINTOUT} expressions themselves. }{End SubSec Escaping to Lisp}{Begin SubSec User-Defined Commands}{Title User-Defined Commands}{TextThe collection of commands and options outlined above is aimed at fulfilling all common printing needs.
