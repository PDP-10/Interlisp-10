{Begin SubSec GAINSPACE}{Title GAINSPACE}{TextUsers with large programs and data bases may sometimes find themselves in a situation where they needs to obtain more space, and are willing to pay the price of eliminating some or all of the context information that the various user-assistance facilities such as the programmer's assistant, file package, CLISP, etc., have accumulated during the course of his session.  The function {fn GAINSPACE} provides an easy way to selectively throw away accumulated data:{FnDef {Name GAINSPACE} {Args }{TextPrints a list of deletable objects, allowing the user to specify at each point what should be discarded and what should be retained.  For example:{lispcode&larr;(GAINSPACE)purge history lists ? Yespurge everything, or just the properties, e.g., SIDE, LISPXPRINT, etc. ?just the propertiesdiscard definitions on property lists ? Yesdiscard old values of variables ? Yeserase properties ? Noerase CLISP translations? Yes}}}{fn GAINSPACE} is driven by the list {var GAINSPACEFORMS}{index GAINSPACEFORMS Var}.  Each element on {var GAINSPACEFORMS} is of the form {lisp ({arg PRECHECK} {arg MESSAGE} {arg FORM} {arg KEYLST})}.  If {arg PRECHECK}, when evaluated, returns {lisp NIL}, {fn GAINSPACE} skips to the next entry.  For example, the user will not be asked whether or not to purge the history list if it is not enabled.  Otherwise, {fn ASKUSER} ({PageRef Fn ASKUSER}) is called with the indicated {arg MESSAGE} and the (optional) {arg KEYLST}.  If the user responds {lisp No}, i.e., {fn ASKUSER} returns {lisp N}, {fn GAINSPACE} skips to the next entry.  Otherwise, {arg FORM} is evaluated with the variable {var RESPONSE}{index RESPONSE Var} bound to the value of {fn ASKUSER}.  In the above example, the {arg FORM} for the "{lisp purge history lists}" question calls {fn ASKUSER} to ask "{lisp purge everything, {ellipsis}}" only if the user had responded {lisp Yes}.  If the user had responded with {lisp Everything}, the second question would not have been asked.The "{lisp erase properties}" question is driven by a list {var SMASHPROPSMENU}.{index SMASHPROPSMENU Var}  Each element on this list is of the form {lisp ({arg MESSAGE} . {arg PROPS})}.  The user is prompted with {arg MESSAGE} (by {fn ASKUSER}), and if he responds {lisp Yes}, {arg PROPS} is added to the list {var SMASHPROPS}.{index SMASHPROPS Var}  The "{lisp discard definitions on property lists}" and "{lisp discard old values of variables}" questions also add to {var SMASHPROPS}.  The user will not be prompted for any entry on {var SMASHPROPSMENU} for which all of the corresponding properties are already on {var SMASHPROPS}.  {var SMASHPROPS} is initially set to the value of {var SMASHPROPSLST}.{index SMASHPROPSLST Var}  This permits the user to specify in advance those properties which he always wants to be discarded, and not be asked about them subsequently.  After finishing all the entries on {var GAINSPACEFORMS}, {fn GAINSPACE} checks to see if the value of {var SMASHPROPS} is non-{lisp NIL}, and if so, does a {fn MAPATOMS}, i.e., looks at every atom in the system, and erases the indicated properties.Note that the user can change or add new entries to {var GAINSPACEFORMS} or {var SMASHPROPSMENU}, so that {fn GAINSPACE} can also be used to purge structures that the user's programs have accumulated.}{End SubSec GAINSPACE}</pre>
