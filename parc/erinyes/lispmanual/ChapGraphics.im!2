{Begin Chapter Graphics Output Operations}{Title Graphics Output Operations}{TextStreams are used as the basis for all I/O operations.  Files are implemented as streams that can support character printing and reading operations, and file pointer manipulation.  An image stream is a type of stream that also provides an interface for graphical operations.  All of the operations that can applied to streams can be applied to image streams.  For example, an image stream can be passed as the argument to {fn PRINT}, to print something on an image stream.  In addition, special functions are provided to draw lines and curves and perform other graphical operations.  Calling these functions on a stream that is not an image stream will generate an error.{Include GraphicsPrimitives}{Include ImageStreams}{Include Fonts}{Include ImageObjects}{Include ImageStreamsImpl}}{End Chapter Graphics Output Operations}
