If so, this should be documented.}Usually, function application is done automatically by the Interlisp interpreter.  If a form is typed into Interlisp whose {fn CAR} is a function, this function is applied to the arguments in the {fn CDR} of the form.  These arguments are evaluated or not, and bound to the function parameters, as determined by the type of the function, and the body of the function is evaluated.  This sequence is repeated as each form in the body of the function is evaluated.There are some situations where it is necessary to explicitly call the evaluator, and Interlisp supplies a number of functions that will do this.  These functions take "functional arguments", which may either be litatoms with function definitions, or expr definition forms such as {lisp (LAMBDA (X) {ellipsis})}, or {lisp FUNARG} expressions (see {PageRef Term Functional Arguments}).{index Applying functions to arguments}{FnDef {FnName APPLY} {FnArgs FN ARGLIST {anonarg}}{TextApplies the function {arg FN} to the arguments in the list {arg ARGLIST}, and returns its value.  {fn APPLY} is a lambda function, so its arguments are evaluated, but the individual elements of {arg ARGLIST} are not evaluated.  Therefore, lambda and nlambda functions are treated the same by {fn APPLY}{emdash}lambda functions take their arguments from {arg ARGLIST} without evaluating them.  For example:{lispcode_(APPLY 'APPEND '((PLUS 1 2 3) (4 5 6)))(PLUS 1 2 3 4 5 6)}Note that {arg FN} may explicitly evaluate one or more of its arguments itself.  For example, the system function {fn SETQ} is an nlambda function that explicitly evaluates its second argument.  Therefore, {lisp (APPLY 'SETQ '(FOO (ADD1 3)))} will set {lisp FOO} to 4, instead of setting it to the expression {lisp (ADD1 3)}.{fn APPLY} can be used for manipulating expr definitions, for example:{lispcode_(APPLY '(LAMBDA (X Y) (ITIMES X Y)) '(3 4))12}}}{FnDef {FnName APPLY*} {FnArgs FN ARG{SUB 1} ARG{SUB 2} {ellipsis} ARG{SUB N}}{Type NOSPREAD}{TextNospread version of {fn APPLY}.

For example, {lisp 'FOO} reads as {lisp (QUOTE FOO)}.  This is the form used for examples in this manual.Since giving {fn QUOTE} more than one argument is almost always a parentheses error, and one that would otherwise go undetected, {fn QUOTE} itself generates an error in this case, {lisp PARENTHESIS ERROR}.{index PARENTHESIS ERROR Error}}}{FnDef {FnName KWOTE} {FnArgs X}{TextValue is an expression which when evaluated yields {arg X}.

While evaluating {arg FORM}, the function {fn EVAL} behaves in a special way.

During the execution of {arg EVALHOOKFN}, this special evaluation is turned off.

For programming iterative computations, it is usually better to use the CLISP Iterative Statement facility ({PageRef Tag IterativeStatement}), which provides a more general and complete facility for expressing iterative statements.

Consider the function definition:{lispcode(DEFINEQ (FOO (LST)            (FIE LST (FUNCTION (LAMBDA (Z) (ITIMES Z Z))]}{lisp FOO} calls the function {lisp FIE} with the value of {lisp LST} and the expr definition {lisp (LAMBDA (Z) (LIST (CAR Z)))}.If {lisp FOO} is run interpreted, it doesn't make any difference whether {fn FUNCTION} or {fn QUOTE} is used.  However, when {lisp FOO} is compiled, if {fn FUNCTION} is used the compiler will define and compile the expr definition as an auxiliary function (See {PageRef Tag CompilingFUNCTION}).  The compiled expr definition will run considerably faster, which can make a big difference if it is applied repeatedly.Note:  Compiling {fn FUNCTION} will {it not} create an auxiliary function if it is a functional argument to a function that compiles open, such as most of the mapping functions ({fn MAPCAR}, {fn MAPLIST}, etc.).If {arg ENV} is not {lisp NIL}, it can be a list of variables that are (presumably) used freely by {arg FN}.  In this case, the value of {fn FUNCTION} is an expression of the form {lisp (FUNARG {arg FN} {arg POS})}, where {arg POS} is a stack pointer to a frame that contains the variable bindings for those variables on {arg ENV}.  {arg ENV} can also be a stack pointer itself, in which case the value of {fn FUNCTION} is {lisp (FUNARG {arg FN} {arg ENV})}.  Finally, {arg ENV} can be an atom, in which case it is evaluated, and the value interpreted as described above.}}{Tag FUNARG}{index *PRIMARY* FUNARG Litatom}{index Variable bindings}As explained above, one of the possible values that {fn FUNCTION} can return is the form {lisp (FUNARG {arg FN} {arg POS})}, where {arg FN} is a function and {arg POS} is a stack pointer.  {lisp FUNARG} is not a function itself.  Like {lisp LAMBDA} and {lisp NLAMBDA}, it has meaning and is specially recognized by Interlisp only in the context of applying a function to arguments.In other words, the expression {lisp (FUNARG {arg FN} {arg POS})} is used exactly like a function.  When a {lisp FUNARG} expression is applied or is {fn CAR} of a form being {fn EVAL}'ed, the {fn APPLY} or {fn EVAL} takes place in the access environment specified by {arg ENV} (see {PageRef Tag STACK}).  Consider the following example:{lispcode_ (DEFINEQ (DO.TWICE (FN VAL)              (APPLY* FN (APPLY* FN VAL))) )(DO.TWICE)_ (DO.TWICE [FUNCTION (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X X))]            5)20_ (SETQ VAL 1)1_ (DO.TWICE [FUNCTION (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X VAL))]            5)15_ (DO.TWICE [FUNCTION (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X VAL)) (VAL)]            5)7}{lisp DO.TWICE} is defined to apply a function {lisp FN} to a value {lisp VAL}, and apply {lisp FN} again to the value returned;  in other words it calculates {lisp (FN (FN VAL))}.  Given the expr definition {lisp (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X X))}, which doubles a given value, it correctly calculates {lisp (FN (FN 5))} = {lisp (FN 10)} = 20.  However, when given {lisp (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X VAL))}, which should add the value of the global variable {lisp VAL} to the argument {lisp X}, it does something unexpected, returning 15, rather than 5+1+1 = 7.  The problem is that when the expr definition is evaluated, it is evaluated in the context of {lisp DO.TWICE}, where {lisp VAL} is bound to the second argument of {lisp DO.TWICE}, namely 5.  In this case, one solution is to use the {arg ENV} argument to {fn FUNCTION} to construct a {lisp FUNARG} expression which contains the value of {lisp VAL} at the time that the {fn FUNCTION} is executed.  Now, when {lisp (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X VAL))} is evaluated, it is evaluated in an environment where the global value of {lisp VAL} is accessable.  Admittedly, this is a somewhat contrived example (it would be easy enough to change the argument names to {lisp DO.TWICE} so there would be no conflict), but this situation arises occasionally with large systems of programs that construct functions, and pass them around.Note:  System functions with functional arguments ({fn APPLY}, {fn MAPCAR}, etc.) are compiled so that their arguments are local, and not accessable (see {PageRef Term LOCALVARS}).  This reduces problems with conflicts with free variables used in functional arguments.{lisp FUNARG} expressions can be used for more than just circumventing the clashing of variables.  For example, a {lisp FUNARG} expression can be returned as the value of a computation, and then used "higher up".  Furthermore, if the function in a {lisp FUNARG} expression {it sets} any of the variables contained in the frame, only the frame would be changed.  For example, consider the following function:{lispcode_(DEFINEQ (MAKECOUNTER (CNT)   (FUNCTION [LAMBDA NIL                (PROG1 CNT (SETQ CNT (ADD1 CNT]             (CNT)))]}The function {lisp MAKECOUNTER} returns a {lisp FUNARG} that increments and returns the previous value of the counter {lisp CNT}.  However, this is done within the environment of the call to {lisp MAKECOUNTER} where {fn FUNCTION} was executed, which the {lisp FUNARG} expression "carries around" with it, even after {lisp MAKECOUNTER} has finished executing.  Note that each call to {lisp MAKECOUNTER} creates a {lisp FUNARG} expression with a new, independent environment, so that multiple counters can be generated and used:{lispcode_ (SETQ C1 (MAKECOUNTER 1))(FUNARG (LAMBDA NIL (PROG1 CNT (SETQ CNT (ADD1 CNT)))) #1,13724/*FUNARG)_ (APPLY C1)1_ (APPLY C1)2_ (SETQ C2 (MAKECOUNTER 17))(FUNARG (LAMBDA NIL (PROG1 CNT (SETQ CNT (ADD1 CNT)))) #1,13736/*FUNARG)_ (APPLY C2)17_ (APPLY C2)18_ (APPLY C1)3_ (APPLY C2)19}By creating a {lisp FUNARG} expression with {fn FUNCTION}, a program can create a function object which has updateable binding(s) associated with the object which last {it between} calls to it, but are only accessible through that instance of the function.  For example, using the {lisp FUNARG} device, a program could maintain two different instances of the same random number generator in different states, and run them independently.{Note We need better examples of the use of FUNARG, using (and pointing out the differences between) both upward and downward funargs}{note is there any way for a fn definition to be a funarg (perhaps a DEFINE with an ENV argument)?  It doesn't work to PUTD a FUNARG expression into a fn --- applying the function produces an U.D.F. error.  Perhaps the evaluator should recognize FUNARG expressions as function definitions.}{note what happens if you reference free variables within a funcarg that are not in the var list that the funarg was created with??}{Begin Note}Date: 26 MAY 1982 2333-PDTFrom: MASINTER.PAThe last editdate on the code for generating FUNARGs from variable lists was 1980.
