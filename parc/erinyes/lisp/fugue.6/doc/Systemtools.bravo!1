SYSTEM TOOLSTHE PROFILE TOOL, INSTALL LISP TOOL AND DIAGNOSTICSWhen the Xerox 1108 is in the base state (a bouncing white square on a dark background,) The InstallLispTool, Profile Tool and Diagnostics can be invoked.  Base state is entered by doing a 1-boot.   If the bouncing white square does not appear, make sure you have correctly pre-loaded software, as described in Installing Software on the Diagnostics Volume.Each of these tools displays its own window, containing parameters and commands.  These are selected with the left mouse button.  Parameter menus are available in some cases, and they may be selected by pressing either both mouse buttons on a two-button mouse, or using the middle mouse button on a three- button mouse.   Hereafter, the parameter selection will be referred to as the middle mouse button. The Delete and Next function keys may also be used in the Install Tool and Profile Tool windows.     The Profile ToolThe Profile Tool enables the user to select a number of default parameters to be used when installing fresh Interlisp-D sysouts from a FileServer.  The defaults will appear in the Install Tool Window (see below), and may be changed there if necessary.Summary:  * to activate the tool, click middle mouse button * select the parameters you wish to set or change* select Set Profile command* confirm the mouse iconDetails:The Profile window is divided into the following regions:* a herald name, consisting of Profile Tool date and time of creation* a two-line message sub-window, which is blank* a parameter sub-window* a command sub-window* a file sub window for messagesThe Profile Window contains these parameters:User:									Password:Domain:									Organization:			FileServer: {IFS, NS}NSLisp:PUPLisp:PARAMETER ITEMSUser:  Your NS/Pup registered user name.Password:  Associated with registered name for login.  You do not have to supply your password in the Profile; you may type it into the Install Tool window.Domain:  Name defined in your Clearinghouse database.Organization:  Name defined in your Clearinghouse database.If you do not have an NS Fileserver, the Domain and Organization names may be names of your choice.File Server:  Selects the type of File Server protocol (NS or IFS)NSLisp:  Complete pathway filename of the Lisp sysout file to be retrieved from an NS type FileServer.PUPLisp:  Complete pathway filename of the Lisp sysout file to be retrieved from a PUP type FileServer.The Install Lisp ToolThe tool window is divided into the following regions:	* a herald name, consisting of Install Lisp Tool date and time of creation	* a two-line message sub-window, which is blank when the Tool is first invoked	* a parameter sub-window 	* a command sub-window	* a file sub-window for messages relevant to the command selectedThe Install Tool Window contains the following parameters:Doc: {General, ErrorMsg}										File Server: {IFS, NS}File: [Server:Domain:Org]<Directory>SubDirectories>FileName.sysoutVolume:															VMem Size (Pages)User:																Password:Domain:															Organization:And the following commands:Install File!	StartVolume!		Set VMem Size!         	Floppy!       	Help!Erase Volume! 	Scavenge Volume!	Remote Boot!	 	Quit!Certain parameters are relevant to certain commands.  The Defaults from the Profile Tool will appear in the File Server, File, User, Password, Domain and Organization fields.  For example, check the default FileServer, and File name you want to install. Enter the Volume name for the installation if not the default.  Enter your user name and password if these were not defaulted, as well as Domain and Organization.  You are then ready to button Install  File.Using the middle mouse button on Doc, File Server, or Volume Menu changes the shape of the arrow to horizontal, and pops up a menu of values which may be selected.  Using  the middle mouse button on any of the parameters also changes the shape of the arrow to horizontal, and reveals the Window Manager, which may be used to Move the Install Tool's window.PARAMETER ITEMSDoc:  Used in conjunction with the Help command.  The General doc displays the  write-up of the InstallLispTool (the document you're reading now).  The ErrorMsg doc displays the meanings of the error messages you may encounter when selecting a command, in the file sub-window.  The file sub-window may be scrolled on the left hand side.  You may want to use Zoom (parameter in the Window Manger) to enlarge the window to full-screen size to display the entire General or ErrorMsg document.File Server:  Selects file server protocol types used with the Install File command.File:  Complete pathway name of the Lisp sysout file to be retrieved from the File Server.  For example, an NS File might be: [Phylex:XSIS:Xerox]<LispCourse>LispClass.sysoutAn equivalent but shorter NS File name is:[Phylex:]<LispCourse>LispClass.sysoutAn example of an IFS pathway would be:  [Rose]<Lisp>Demo.sysoutThe Server, Domain and Organization naming convention restricts these to AlphaNumerics plus the following special characters: " - : # SP (SPACE).  The first character must be a letter, or else the error message "scan error on Server:Domain:Organization" will be posted.Volume Menu:  The menu selections available with the two-button or center button pop-up menu are determined when your system is partitioned.  The volume named Lisp is the default value for this field.  The Diagnostics Volume contains the Diagnostics Files loaded from the floppy disk of the same name.  The Boot Lisp Volume contains a fresh Lisp sysout, which can be  selected by the Remote Boot command, rather than reloading fresh Lisp from floppy disks. VMem Size (Pages):  Shows the Virtual Memory size for the Volume parameter.  At the present time, users cannot change this parameter; it is a development tool only.User:  NS/Pup registered user name.Password:  Associated with registered name for login.Domain:  Name defined in your Clearinghouse database.Organization:  Name defined in your Clearinghouse database.If you do not have an NS Fileserver, the Domain and Organization names may be names of your choice.COMMAND ITEMSInstall File:  Installs the file named in the File parameter and fetches it from the File Server to the 1108 partition  named in the Volume parameter. A confirming mouse icon will appear in the file sub-window with the name of the Volume to which the File will be installed from the File Server.  The file transfer can be aborted with the STOP key.Start Volume:  Boots the Lisp Volume parameter.  There is a confirming mouse icon for this command.Set VMem Size:  Extends the Virtual Memory size of a Volume according to parameters.  As mentioned earlier, this parameter cannot be changed by users yes; it is a development tool.Floppy:  (Not yet Implemented)Erase Volume:  Selected Volume parameter contents erased.  There is a confirming mouse icon for this command.Scavenge Volume:  Scavenges selected volume and produces MSScavenge.log file in that volume.  There is a confirming mouse icon for this command.  The file sub-window message is:Volume = LispnScavenging...donevolume repaired, file log completeN files on volumeNo problems found.Remote Boot:  Cross-copies boot file from one volume (Source) to another (Destination).  The Source volume must be a fresh Lisp sysout to be boot-able.  This command does not use the parameters.  Its selection brings up the Remote Boot window, explained below.Details:The Remote Boot Option window is divided into the following regions:* a herald name consisting of Remote Boot Option date and time of creation* a two line message sub-window, which is blank when first invoked* a parameter sub-window for Source and Destination volume names* a command sub-window for Start or Quit* a file sub-window for messages.The parameters and commands appear:Source Volume:						Dest.Volume:Start!Quit! PARAMETER ITEMSSource Volume: Partition's Volume name (e.g. BootLisp, Lisp, Lisp2, Lisp3), from which the fresh Lisp sysout will be copied.Dest.Volume:  Destination Volume name (e.g. Lisp, Lisp2, Lisp3) to which the sysout will be copied.  COMMAND ITEMSStart:  Does the obvious. File sub-window asks for confirmation of Source and Destination with the mouse icon.  After copied, asks for confirmation to Boot Destination Volume.Quit:  Back to the bouncing white square. Quit: Returns you to the bouncing white square. The Online Diagnostics ToolThe programs for these tests were loaded from floppy disk to the Diagnostics partition of the 1108 in the Pre-Loading operation, and are accessible from the bouncing white square.  These tests are for the Display, Keyboard, Echo Test (Ethernet), and Floppy Disk Drive (including Cleaning--see Maintenance section of this manual).All of the tests are documented online through the Help command.   Summary:* to activate, click the right mouse button* select the Test to be Executed* select the parameter(s) for the Test* select command* or select Help command to get the documentation on the TestsThe Diagnostics window consists of:* the herald name Diagnostics* a command and parameter sub-window* a file sub-window for messages and documentationDetails:To read all of the documentation, you may find it convenient to use the middle mouse button to invoke the Window Manager, activate Zoom with the horizontal arrow, and then move the top line of the file sub-window upwards by using the left mouse button positioning the cursor on the box on the right hand side of this line.  COMMANDSHelp:  Used with parameter "None", displays the complete documentation on how to use the Diagnostics window, including the Window Manager.  Used with one of the parameters, displays the complete documentation for that Test.Start and Cancel:  Start the test selected or quit the Diagnostics program.PARAMETERSType of test to be executed:Display, Keyboard, Echo, Floppy Disk Drive. For details, please review the online documentation before Starting these tests.(635)\f1i45f0I41f9 16f0 57i30I10i271I45i1I2i504I8f5b17f0B1540f5b23f0B4705i1I1331f5b28f0B
