The purpose of this documentation is to provide you with a description of special features unique to this operating environment.  Please be certain to read through the complete package before executing commands.  These tools will allow you to test/verify the operation of the Keyboard, Display, Floppy Disk and Ethernet. Additionally the floppy disk facilities include a head cleaning routine to be used in conjunction with a special cleaning diskette.  Further description of the individual tests can be found towards the end of this documentation."L];    IF NOT DiagnosticsOps.More[] THEN RETURN;    DiagnosticsOps.PutLine[      "	Commands are invoked by clicking POINT (left mouse button) with the tip of the cursor overlaying the command (as you have done with the ""HELP!"" command).

If your mouse has three buttons, pressing down the middle button is the same as chording a two-button mouse."L];    DiagnosticsOps.PutLine[      "	Pressing and immediately releasing (clicking) a mouse button invokes various actions, which will be explained later.

Now try moving it into the window and notice that it doesn't change shape unless you go back outside of the window again, and then only if you go out through one of the two edges not represented by the cursor. Changing the shape of the cursor is how you tell the Move! command which corner you are talking about."L];    DiagnosticsOps.PutLine[      "	Finally, position the cursor so that it is not on the top of the HELP window (so you won't accidently cover this message), and click POINT.

There will be times, when you begin using the Mesa development environment more, that you will have many windows on the screen at one time. Some may completely cover others. It is not uncommon to forget a window when it is on the bottom of a stack and thereby invisible. You can find out which windows you have by invoking ""Bottom"" in the visible windows; by making all windows tiny with ""Size""; or by making sure that at least a tiny corner of each window is visible.
